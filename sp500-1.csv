At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will announce the opportunity for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Jim Sjoreen.\nJim Sjoreen: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about liquidity and capital resources, premiums, deposits, expenses and income from operations are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday, and our report on forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today, and invite to you visit Lincoln's website, www.LincolnFinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations, and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures. A general account supplement is again available on the website as well. Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Fred Crawford, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis Glass. Dennis?\nDennis Glass: Thanks, Jim, and good morning to all of you on the call. Let me start at the top. This is the first quarter in many that we achieved positive net flows in all lines of businesses. Sales and deposits were ahead of last year, and we have seen no appreciable uptick in surrender activity in any line of business. Finally, and importantly, all business lines were profitability. Given the recognized rough environment, the results reflect the core strength of our operating model, and the value of the franchise. Our reported net loss reflected the impairments of goodwill on our annuity business, due to capital market factors. Fred, will comment on the specifics. In recent months, our industry has benefited modestly from some stabilization in the capital markets, and some easing in the turmoil among our important bank and broker partners. At the same time, the industry is beginning to make progress on constructively shaping the next generation of products, including the VA business. The rating agencies have essentially downgraded our entire industry, but you may have noticed this morning, and we are quite pleased that Standard \u0026 Poor's did reaffirm Lincoln's AA- claims-paying rating. Industry actions by the rating agencies have been based on liquidity and capital concerns at a time when the capital markets, while certainly improving somewhat, continued to limit the range of options available to companies. Lincoln has taken decisive actions to protect our balance sheet and to address liquidity. We have cut our common dividend, easing the cash flow burden at the holding company by $400 million annually, and reducing the draw on subsidiary capital. In April, we completed a 12% workforce reduction. The workforce reduction, plus other non-employee expense cuts across the enterprise add up to the $250 million in cost savings run rate that we previously announced. These reductions were strategic, meaning we do not expect sales or service to be materially affected as a result. The savings will be muted on a GAAP basis this year due to DAC offsets. However, the $250 million net of tax will meaningfully benefit statutory capitalization on a run rate basis. On a GAAP basis, net of DAC, tax and related charges, we expect to realize about $45 million of savings in 2009, with the majority coming in the second half of the year. We substantially reduced debt at the holding company, through subsidiary dividends we have redeemed $600 million of debt, and plan to reduce our commercial paper by another $100 million. We will end the second quarter in a short-term borrowing position of roughly $500 million. Should capital markets remain frozen, which I do not expect, we have $2 billion of contingent borrowing capacity in the form of intercompany agreements and committed bank lines to handle both, any disruption in the commercial paper markets, and senior debt maturities maturing over the next few years for Lincoln. We also have ample liquidity in our principal reinsurance subsidiaries. Now that we have seen the level of sales and surrender activity during the first quarter, we feel comfortable moving $1 billion out of short-term assets into long-term investments, with the expectation of picking up 500 basis points of yield over the balance of the year. In the quarter, we increased Lincoln Life's capital base by $240 million, through a life reinsurance transaction, and have initiatives well underway to add more capital to the subsidiaries. Based on preliminary statutory data, our estimated RBC at the end of the quarter is strong. RBC is dependent on many factors, but I'm currently comfortable that we will be able to maintain satisfactory levels in 2009. Turning to our businesses. The economic environment has made sales more challenging, and we expect this pressure to continue in the near term. Not surprisingly, consumers and their advisors are taking more time before committing to major financial decisions. Our frontline employees, including wholesalers, planners and client service representatives are doing a very good job in this environment, as reflected in our sales and net flows in the quarter. At Lincoln Financial Network, and Lincoln Financial Distributors, our retail and wholesale distribution companies, the story remains relatively unchanged from the prior quarters. We are focused on providing our clients with advice to help them sort through the noise, work hard to attract deposits, and carefully managing expenses. In the first quarter, LFD took the strategic step of combining the smaller fixed annuity sales team with the larger and more productive variable annuity team. This action has been well received by our client firms, and has resulted in the expansion of our fixed annuity distribution, across more geography and client firms. In Retirement Solutions, our Individual Annuities and Defined Contributions had a good production inflow quarter. Total Individual Annuity deposits were $2.2 billion, and Fixed Annuity deposits of $600 million, almost doubled quarter-over-quarter, and while weak by historical comparison, VA deposits of $1.6 billion and positive net flows of over $400 million were good results given the environment. The industry has been moving to de-risk VA guarantees, and in January, we made changes to raise fees, add investment limitations and reduce benefits. We expect to continue balancing reduced product risk, customer value, and returns. The next set of changes will further reduce risk, but we intend to remain competitive in the VA marketplace. In our Defined Contribution business, deposits were up slightly from the prior year quarter, while net flows improved dramatically. We saw a strong growth in the large case market, and low lapse rates across our DC product lineup are contributing to the favorable net flow story. First quarter life insurance sales were down 16% from a year ago. Permanent and COLI sales declined while term and BOLI both posted strong year-over-year increases. The launch of a new term portfolio at the end of March, and continued softness in the high end life insurance sales will likely cause these trends to continue in the near term. The Group Protection business continued to deliver very solid results. First quarter sales were flat compared with last year, reflecting competitive environment, and a client base that is closely watching employee levels in costs. In Investment Management, results at Delaware benefitted from improved investment performance, ongoing expense initiative, and their well-deserved reputation. During the quarter, Delaware's total net inflows turned positive for the first time since the third quarter of 2007, reflecting strong institutional inflows. Now, let me turn it over to Fred.\nFred Crawford: Thank you, Dennis. Focusing first on income from operations, we recorded income of $171 million, or $0.66 per share in the quarter. The storyline is similar for all major insurance operations. We recorded positive tax true-ups, a result of filing our tax return early this year, offset by negative retrospective DAC unlocking, and lower investment income as we remain more liquid in the general account. Virtually all segments benefited from lower expenses, the result of cost cutting, reduced volumes and some timing of expenditures. However, consolidated results were impacted by a $64 million charge recorded in other operations for an arbitration ruling handed down in the first quarter. The ruling effectively unwinds a small piece of Lincoln Re sale to Swiss Re, involving a treaty with three individual disability income blocks. While we are still assessing our legal options and the financial and administrative issues involved, we believe it prudent to establish an allowance against various recoverables previously established for this business. We will be conducting a review of reserves in the coming quarters as the business is integrated back into our operations. Excluding this charge to other operations, we believe reported segment earnings represent the current normalized earnings trends in our core businesses. Turning to items that impacted net income. Net realized losses and impairments related to general account assets were approximately $85 million after tax and DAC. Gross general account losses were $247 million pretax and pre-DAC. The only significant concentration being RMBS, which represented about a third of the losses. We adapted the new FASB guidance for the recognition of impairments which reduced pretax and DAC impairments by approximately $112 million. After considerable review, we recorded a $600 million goodwill impairment related to our annuity business. This charge to goodwill reflects the rise in current discount rates applied to the business, along with the market's impact on account values and sales expectations. Important; this charge does not reflect our view of the long-term value of the annuity franchise, which continues to drive positive flows, supported by a significant wholesaling force and strong client relationships. Also impacting net income were the results of the variable annuity hedge program, focusing on living benefits we experienced hedge breakage of $77 million pretax and DAC, and before the effects of FAS 157. The breakage was driven by being modestly over hedged on our income benefits. We refined our estimate of the non-performance risk factor embedded in FAS 157, which resulted in a $55 million pretax and DAC loss in the quarter. Absent, refining our estimate, the NPR would have produced a significant gain in the quarter. We ended the quarter with hedge assets equal to our hedge target as defined under FAS 133 or the economic calculation of the benefit liabilities, this excluding the impact of NPR. Turning to capital and liquidity. We have been building up liquidity in our insurance company given current market conditions. We estimate insurance company cash and liquidity in excess of $3 billion, and maintain contingent liquidity capacity from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. As Dennis noted in his comments, we have retired $600 million of holding company debt at the end of April, with another $100 million reduction planned for later this quarter. Recognizing day-to-day liquidity will fluctuate, we expect to manage to an average short-term borrowing position of around $500 million throughout the year. In support of that position and as a contingency to any term debt maturities, we have contractual borrowing capacity from our insurance subsidiaries of roughly $1 billion, together with $1 billion in unused bank lines maturing in 2011. Furthermore, we expect that our common dividend reduction and cost initiatives have set the stage for reduced holding company cash needs, and allows us to build insurance company capitalization as markets recover. We estimate our first quarter RBC to be in the 380% range, after giving effect for impairments in the quarter, and the $240 million of capital raised from our Life reinsurance transaction. Remember that we utilize a captive for our VA business, and as of quarter end, maintained hedge assets well in excess of current statutory reserving guidelines. Therefore, understating our current RBC as compared to onshore programs. While we have not yet finalized our estimates for VACARVM, we expect the implementation will increase required statutory reserves, and are currently doing the modeling work under various market scenarios. The insurance company dividend action in the second quarter will be offset to some degree by the contribution of corporate assets, namely our media holdings to the insurance company, where we maintain other private equity positions. We would estimate the net negative impact of the two actions to be approximately 20 points of RBC. We continue to work on long-term reserve securitization transactions of more modest size in the $200 million to $300 million range, and hope to execute a transaction in the coming months. Let me now turn to a brief comment on our business segment, starting with our retirement businesses. Average account values in our annuity business decreased by roughly $1.7 billion in the quarter, driving expense assessment revenue down by 4% sequentially, and our defined contribution businesses, average variable account values were down just under $800 million, with overall expense assessment down 7% sequentially. Mitigating these effects of the markets were $1 billion in positive retirement flows, with balanced contribution from variable and fixed annuities, and Defined Contribution business lines. As noted earlier in my comments, the retirement segments experienced weakness in investment margins as a result of remaining more liquid. We estimate this had We estimate this had a $7 million impact on annuity earnings, and about a $4 million impact in our Defined Contribution segment. As Dennis noted, we are moving to a more fully invested position, and would expect to mitigate some of this impact in future quarters. While VA death benefit mortality expense continued to weigh on our annuity results, we didn't have material DAC unlocking having reset our reversion to the mean assumptions in the fourth quarter. We are monitoring policyholder behavior, and are yet to see noticeable movement in our surrenders, exchanges or withdrawal rates in our VA products. Fundamentals remain relatively stable in our life business, with average UL and VUL in-force up 3% over the prior year. Account values is down 2%, driven primarily by the market's impact on VUL balances. Both metrics will be modestly impacted by our reinsurance capital transaction closed at the quarter end. We continue to experience some weakness in mortality margins. This is not an issue of gross mortality, rather the result of accounting treatment under FAS 113 for reinsurance recoveries in the period. The accounting guidance has the effect of amortizing reinsurance gains and losses on certain blocks of businesses over future period. Similar to the retirement segment comments, our liquidity position is impacted the period's earnings by roughly $3 million. As we look forward, we estimate the reinsurance transaction closed at the end of the first quarter will reduce life segment quarterly earnings by roughly $7 million. This is somewhat offset by income on the capital generated of roughly $2 million per quarter, which flows through other operations line item. Overall loss ratios in our Group business were favorable coming in at just under 71%. The disability lines continue to out perform. We believe the weak job market has actually contributed to lower rates of incidents. Non-medical net earned premium increased 6% over the comparable 2008 quarter. While pleased with the growth, this is where we are experiencing the impact of the current economic conditions, the headwinds of lower overall employment, and salary levels. Delaware returned to profitability and positive flows in the quarter, with the mark-to-market on seed capital negatively impacting earnings by about $2 million. First quarter market decline drove assets under management down by $3.6 billion in the quarter. We expect quarterly earnings to remain in the low single digits throughout 2009. Now, let me turn it back to Dennis for some closing comments. Dennis?\nDennis Glass: Thanks, Fred. The solid first quarter operating results and actions we are taking establish a good base for more progress during the year. Earnings will be added to over the year by cost reduction actions, and deployment of $1 billion of investable funds into the market. If the recent equity market rally holds, this will increase fund balances, and also add to earnings. We have sufficient financial flexibility at the holding company for the foreseeable future. We are focusing our attention on adding capital to the insurance subsidiaries as some level of additional investment losses are likely to occur. All of us recognize that external factors remain an issue, and can change quickly, but in general, I'm confident in Lincoln's strength, and that we will manage through the challenges in 2009. Now let's go to Q\u0026A.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) For our first question we go to Ed Spehar with Bank of America.\nEd Spehar: Thank you. Two questions. First, Fred, I was wondering if you could talk about the bank lines and the letters of credit that are associated with the intercompany reinsurance. The question really is, to what extent does the bank line get drawn down further if the equity mark were to go down significantly, let's say the 700 that you talk about in the 10-K? The second question is on goodwill. I guess it's a little bit hard to understand how you get a goodwill charge that's market related of this size, when you are talking about the Jefferson-Pilot acquisition where there really wasn't a significant variable business.\nFred Crawford: In terms of the bank line and the LOCs, we have about a $3.1 billion total bank facility that is supported by upwards of 20 banks or so, and that bank line allows to us draw either cash borrowings underneath it or issue letters of credit. We have got a little over $2 billion of letters of credit issued, which primarily support reserve redundancy or excess reserve securitization on the life side. We would not anticipate the LOC needs to be climbing here over time, in part due to the interim solution and other mechanics that have lessened the need for reserve securitization on a go-forward basis. So, that's why we are quite confident in the $1 billion of cash availability that backs our liquidity needs as a company, and really actually also backs our commercial paper program as a prime issuer. I also wouldn't expect necessarily the markets in themselves to give rise to a different need for letters of credit under that facility. In this particular case, while we do use the captive for our variable annuity program, we have got fairly significant assets held in Barbados in support of that program that we believe we could utilize to help with the reserving. In terms of the goodwill, it is a bit of an unusual element in terms of when you step back and look at the JP merger, but there's a couple of reasons. First of all, this is the result of the PGAAP allocation process of goodwill when you are going through a merger, and several things drive a goodwill allocation to the annuity business. First, remember that we did in fact acquire a fixed and indexed annuity book from Jefferson-Pilot. So, there was an acquisition there, but you also allocate your goodwill for where you believe there to be benefit in the business after giving affect for the merger. So, for example, expense savings achieved across the company will typically benefit all of the segments, and particularly, the major segments of the company, which would include annuities. Certain revenue synergies by combining the distribution platforms and selling product into each other's distribution network is helpful. Also, we viewed the actual combination with Jefferson-Pilot as creating more capacity to write variable annuities, having a much better balanced mix of earnings and much less of a concentration in equity market exposure as we did in it Lincoln before the time of the merger. So, all of those things contributed to the original allocation of roughly $1 billion of goodwill to the annuity business, and now we've taken the impairment really to reflect the market, and most particularly, the rise in discount rates given the volatility in the market.\nEd Spehar: Fred, just to follow-up on the LOC question, can you just give us some sense of what the dollar amount of LOCs would be related to the VA business versus the life business?\nFred Crawford: Right now we don't really have any LOCs set up for the VA business at this point in time. We do have cash capital that is housed in trust that helped us get reserve relief under, particularly the death benefit reserving requirements which spike up more considerably under AG 34, but we don't really have much in the way of current LOCs allocated to the VA business.\nOperator: We go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.\nJohn Nadel: So really my focus for this morning is on risk-based capital and statutory capital levels. I guess I would be interested in sort of understanding as we look out for the remainder of 2009, is your expectations, especially maybe under some stress scenarios of the ins and outs and just what might cause calculated risk-based capital to fall below 300% by year-end? I mean may be along those same lines just to help sort of direct the discussion, what your expectations are for statutory operating earnings? Is there any meaningful change in your outlook for that relative to 2008?\nFred Crawford: I will try to give you some color around RBC and see if in the process I get to answer your question. We ended the quarter at 380% RBC, and that RBC was weighed down somewhat by CARVM adjustments, where just the market coming down in the quarter and also not only the impairments we took in the quarter, but also a level of ratings migration, which requires us hold more capital against the bond exposures or asset exposures that we have under the RBC calculation. So, you've got a couple of different things that were influencing that and then, of course, we closed on the reinsurance transaction, which bolstered RBC in the period. As we go into the second quarter, we've got a couple of moving parts. We have got the ordinary dividend that we have announced that we'll be taking out of the life company of $400 million. We anticipate contributing the media company assets which is really now more or less a private equity holding of the company to the insurance company, which has in and around a couple hundred million dollar or so positive capital impact albeit with higher risk based capital held against it. Then we continue to explore securitization techniques in the marketplace and are working hard on that. We have been stressing our general account for stress conditions in the asset portfolio with the target of taking the necessary steps to manage our RBC in and around the 350% range, which we would dictate as a longer term range that we want to manage to as a company. So, what we'll dictate dropping below or above that will be things like markets, which as you've seen have done some level of recovery here in the second quarter, a continuation of realized losses, and again we have utilized stress conditions in our estimate of defaults going forward throughout the year. And those will be some of the bigger issues, of course, the pace of sales also has implications and the mix of sales has implications for capital. In terms of statutory earnings, our statutory earnings came on in the quarter roughly on plan with what we would expect when modeling out our RBC. At this moment, absent any unusual fluctuations and realized losses or the equity markets and its impact on CARVM adjustments, we don't expect material deviations in the statutory earning going forward, but again much of this is market related.\nJohn Nadel: If you say statutory earnings in the first quarter around the plan, can you give us a sense?\nFred Crawford: Yes, statutory earnings were after-tax about roughly $180 million. Now, those statutory earnings included the benefits of the ceding commission we collected on the reinsurance transaction, which was in and around $150 million to $160 million range after-tax. If you take into account the reinsurance transaction and the realized losses in the quarter, we had a negative net income. So this is all in, of about $53 million or so. So not much of an impact to total adjusted capital from that result. What pushed down RBC in the quarter was the fact that the denominator, RBC kicked up in the quarter, mainly due to ratings migration.\nJohn Nadel: Last one for you. It would just be on the commercial home loan portfolio. I know you guys talk about a 59% weighted average LTV, but that's I think based on original valuations. Do you have something more recent?\nFred Crawford: No, we tend not to do regular appraisals on the properties with just one exception. When these properties move into more of a watch or concerned list category, then we will typically as a matter of routine get updated appraisals on those properties. So, much of that LTV is an origination LTV, recognizing that we have got a well-aged portfolio of commercial real estate, meaning that we booked many of these at an originally conservative loan-to-value. Those values rose throughout the years and then more recently, of course, have declined. What we tend to focus on as a more immediate measure of the health of the portfolio is the debt service coverage on the portfolio, which stands at about 1.6 times. This is a particularly good metric. First of all, it's a current metric. Secondly, it's also a particularly good metric when you realize that much of our portfolio is amortizing.\nOperator: We go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a few questions. The first one, if you could just give us an idea on how much the new FASB rules benefited your book value through better marks, and if there was a net income benefit also for that. Secondly, if you could talk about the chances of you breaching the covenants on your hybrids, and what the implication of that would be? And the last thing, you mentioned that you haven't seen an uptick in withdrawals because the ratings downgrades, but if you just talk about, just general in terms of have you seen any impact on your sales or your competitive position in the markets in any of the products because of the downgrades?\nFred Crawford: Okay, Jimmy, I will take the first two, and then I will hand up to Dennis to comment on sales activity. In terms of the FASB, the FASB Staff Position 115-2, on OTI, we did as we mentioned early adopt it. The impact of it is it effectively lowered the pre-tax and DAC OTTI in the quarter by about $112 million. And most of that was related to not surprisingly structured securities or RMBS, upwards of $100 million of that had really more particularly to do with lowering what otherwise would have been the impairment on RMBS in the quarter. Now in addition, we also took a pre-tax and pre-DAC $200 million cumulative adjustment from adopting as of 1 Jan, 2009. After-tax and DAC, that's about $102 million, and we take that through the statement effectively through the balance sheet. It has the effect of increasing retained earnings and increasing the unrealized loss position by that dollar amount. So, it essentially comes out of earnings and back into OCI. On the second question which is the hybrid, these are the roughly $1.6 billion of capital securities that we'd issued as part of the financing of the merger with Jefferson Pilot. These securities have something called an alternative coupon payment mechanism, which is triggered based on the combination of risk-based capital, earnings, and shareholder equity tests. At the end of the first quarter, we have tripped the earnings or cumulative net income tests and also one of the shareholder equity tests. There's another one, that's a two-prong test. Effectively what that means is that over the coming quarters we are essentially sitting right on top of the trigger, which means over the next couple of quarters, our earnings or net income in the period and the growth in shareholders equity will dictate whether or not indeed, we actually trip these triggers. So, as of right now, we are right on top of it and it will be really the next quarter's results that will dictate. The practical implication of this is that we would have to effectively issue equity in an amount to satisfy the ongoing interest payments under these facilities, until such time you move outside of the trigger event through increasing your shareholders equity, which can come in obviously a number of different forms. We have about $100 million a year of interest expense on the securities. The next couple of payments that are due are in November and January in total about $33 million. So we'll simply have to monitor conditions over the next couple of quarters to see how we operate under these provisions.\nDennis Glass: Jimmy, with respect to the impact of the rating changes on our sales, let me first make the point that the industry has been downgraded, obviously not just Lincoln. And where we stand relative to our principal competitors is pretty good. So that it's not helpful to get downgraded and it does create noise with our retail distribution partners and of course, our wholesale distribution partners take a little harder look at us. So, at the margin, it's not positive. But, again, I come back to the fact that the Lincoln value proposition across the product lines is strong, distribution, knowledgeable people, selling to needs. We've good products that are competitive, not the most competitive, but are competitive and of course, the ratings are important too. But, when we had everything together, again as I've said a couple of times this morning, I have confidence in the strength of the franchise and that we will continue to forward with our fair share of sales in the industry.\nOperator: We go next to Andrew Kligerman with UBS.\nAndrew Kligerman: First question, can you give a little more color, given the loss or the arbitration issue with the Swiss Re contract. Could you come back to that whole transaction going back to 2001 with Swiss Re and give us a sense of what your exposure is right now, involving the Lincoln resale to them? And what should we expect going forward if we might see any charges there?\nFred Crawford: Yeah. This is really a fairly long standing and really the remaining, I guess I would call it the remaining stub, if you will of disputes that took place after the sale of that business. As you recall, having followed us a long time, Andrew and many of you following us, we've gone back and forth over various issues involving the sale of this business over the years. This was an arbitration that had been underway for actually more than a few years, and really involved several components of a small segment of DI business that was sold as part of the transaction. And the dispute involved administrative-related matters, involved reserves and reserve adequacy, involved collection or recoverability from third-party reinsurers that were involved in the blocks. So, frankly, there were several things and crediting rates used on the funds withheld treaty. So, honestly, this was an outstanding carved out item from when we had settled once before on this transaction. So, we had been arbitration for a while and quite frankly got an arbitration ruling that was really unexpected. I believe somewhat unexpected by both parties, which was, we understand both arguments and so we are going to effectively unwind the transaction in its entirety and all of the cash flows back and forth. We simply think at this point in time, based on the nature of the disputed items that it's practical for us to put up a provision against the recoveries and various receivables involved in the transaction over the year and that's what gave rise to the charge. What we will have to do going forward is monitor the reserve adequacy on this business as we would with any business and it's a business that we haven't owned for several years. We have no reason to believe the reserves are adequate or inadequate, but we do need to do that work. That's simply something we can't do until we take full possession of the blocks of business, which we anticipate doing shortly.\nAndrew Kligerman: I see. So, if I recall correctly, years ago you settled, I thought you'd finally settled it for about a $0.50 billion, but then you had this secondary issue outstanding. But at this point, there's nothing we should be expecting with regard to Swiss Re that's kind of behind you. Is that the way to think about it?\nFred Crawford: Yes, there's nothing related specifically to the transaction. Now, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to weigh any and all legal options that we have available to us as a company. So, that continues to be something we review as a company. These were the bucket, if you will, of unresolved items that were in arbitration. So, the only exposure we have is really just the underlying performance of the blocks of business going forward, as with any block of business and we'll have to monitor as we go forward.\nAndrew Kligerman: And then the second question would just be, in terms of your gross realized impairments and losses on sales. Could you give a little color as to what securities represented the biggest component and if you have specifics that'll be great too?\nFred Crawford: Sure. The largest component, as I mentioned, was really a mix of RMBS which included, by the way, a mix of prime and Alt A and subprime. And that was about, if you breakdown the roughly $247 million of pre-tax and DAC impairment, that was about $84 million of it. We then took about $34 million of pre-tax and DAC impairment on automotive-related exposures. These are tended to be a primary, so called tier one suppliers to the auto industry, which were falling on hard times and took impairment there. We took a sizable impairment in what we would call the gaming industry, but more specifically, it was on Harrah's Entertainment Inc of about $22 million. And then, after that, Andrew, really a mix of small, relatively minor impairments that were relatively spread out.\nOperator: We go next to John Hall with Wachovia.\nJohn Hall: I was hoping that, Fred, you might be able to take a look at April as it were, and give us an idea of how the month of April has had an effect on the unrealized loss position in the bond portfolio, and perhaps what it is done for the VACARVM?\nFred Crawford: In terms of unrealized loss, what has happened in April is we've seen corporate spreads come in quite a bit from roughly 550 basis points to, say, 380 basis points for example. So, in general, that has been helpful from an unrealized standpoint. You've also seen, though interest rates rise during that same time period, and so I don't have the April ending pluses and minuses for you, but that's by and large the movements that we've seen since the end of the quarter. In terms of VACARVM, as I mentioned earlier, we are still in the midst of doing some of the modeling and model refinements under various scenarios. Obviously, we have seen a recovery in the market thus far in the second quarter, and VACARVM tends to be particularly sensitive to the markets, whereas FAS 133 type definitions tend to be sensitive to not only markets but also particularly interest rates, and of course, volatility. So I imagine the VACARVM estimates across the industry have recovered somewhat in the month of April, but we are still doing all that modeling work.\nJohn Hall: Maybe I missed the spread, but did you quantify the size of the DI block, the DI assets and liabilities that you are going to be taking on, and did you talk about what effect if any that this might have on the deferred gain that you carry?\nFred Crawford: Yes. We are taking on about $900 million worth of DI reserves in total across the three blocks that we're talking about, that I mentioned. So, over time, you are not talking about a particularly sizable block of business in general when it comes to things like earnings and so forth. I'm sorry, your second question?\nJohn Hall: Whether there is any effect on the deferred gains carried?\nFred Crawford: Yes. John, what we are talking about is, because we sold the business through indemnity reinsurance, we booked a gain at the time of sale and had been amortizing that gain into our earnings. There will be really not a particularly material effect. In fact, my Chief Accounting Officer is nodding his head, none, i.e., no effect related to the amortization of the deferred gains, that's because we've amortized it?\nUnidentified Company Representative: As we didn't have any differed gain really associated with DI block.\nFred Crawford: If you heard that, we didn't have much of a deferred gain on the DI block, and [if it sells], that's part of the component of the component.\nJohn Hall: Great. You chose dividend of funds from the operating subsidiaries, a couple of them up to the holing company. Why did you go that route as opposed to using some of that intercompany borrowing capacity?\nFred Crawford: The main reason, John, was we felt as if it was a more definitive, clear, statement of providing real cash liquidity at the holding company to pay down the debt because, we found folks having a lot of questions surrounding the nature of it, and understanding fully the intercompany lending arrangement. Frankly, we had excess capital in the insurance companies and subsidiaries, and felt that was the higher and better use of the money to just outright pay down debt. So, it has a lasting effect of reducing the leverage and it creates more of a cushion for short-term liquidity needs, including any liquidity surprises that could come with market conditions and what have you. So, we just felt it to be a cleaner move, a cleaner step, and a better balancing of holding company liquidity versus insurance company and capital conditions. I might note it was an ordinary dividend also, meaning, we did not need to or request any special approvals. This is within the ordinary dividend guidelines, albeit as a matter of practice, we spend time with the state, whenever we take out a sizable dividend, which we did of course.\nOperator: For our next question, we go to Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.\nBob Glasspiegel: I will stay on the TARP topic. Dennis, bring me up to speed on where you stand on that? What you think the time horizon for decision is? How important is it that you get it, and is there any need in talking to the government that you actually have to do transactions in order to qualify?\nDennis Glass: Bob, those are questions that frankly most people don't know the answers to, but let me from a big picture perspective, tell you that both, at the time of the former administration, and now currently, the ACLI has been in discussions and making a compelling case to treasury that the insurance industry become eligible for TARP funds, and particularly the CPP. So, at the time, when Secretary Paulson was in charge, I think he thought that including the insurance companies was the right thing. However, the administration has changed. Again, the ACLI is driving conversations with Treasury, but at this point, it's entirely up to treasury, both with respect to the decisions that they make as to eligibility of the insurance industry, and the timing of those decisions Again, I think the case being made by the industry is compelling, particularly in that the same issues, if the recession deepens and the stock market plunges again, the same issues facing the insurance industry will manifest themselves that were manifested by the commercial banking industry. As an industry we have roughly the same relative asset-to-capital ratios as the bank industry does. So, again, to me they are parallel situations, and the insurance industry I think, logically should have access to TARP. However, again, I have no information with respect to whether it will be or what the timing of it is eligible for TARP, and when it would happen.\nBob Glasspiegel: A follow-up. I assume there's no comment relative to the Dow Jones story from a couple of weeks ago of a rumored asset sale and Goldman Sachs being hired?\nDennis Glass: We don't comment on either acquisitions or dispositions that we might be thinking about.\nOperator: For our next question we go to Suneet Kamath with Sanford Bernstein.\nSuneet Kamath: I had a couple of questions on the variable annuity business. As I think about the industry and the comments companies have made, it almost seems like there are two groups. Companies such as yourself that are making changes to the in-force business in terms of price increases, in terms of investment restriction, and then other companies that are just making changes to the new business that they write, and sort of leaving the in-force business intact. I'm wondering as that plays out, given that you are one of the companies presumably making changes to the in-force business, is this going to have an adverse impact on your ability to sell-through third-party channels? That's question number one and then I have a second question.\nDennis Glass: Question number one, I don't think the modest effect on the consumer of the changes that are being made on the in-force block are going to cause any difficulties with our distribution partners. We're quite clear about what flexibility for consequent changes that not only Lincoln but other VA providers have in their contracts. So, I don't think that's particularly a big issue. And what was the second part of that question?\nSuneet Kamath: The second part I actually didn't ask yet, but I will now. Hartford talked about two groups of VA writers, in terms of going forward, one group being the simpler guarantees, low cost kind of companies and the other group being the ones that still offer the richer benefits with higher costs. So I guess I'm wondering if you agree with that and then if that's correct, where do you see Lincoln playing among those two groups.\nDennis Glass: First of all, you heard on numerous occasions that we have been a less rich feature company and in the middle on pricing. So, many of the product changes that are being discussed by the competition, bring their rich benefits more closely to the benefits that we have in place today. We've always been able to compete and take market share, not because we have the most aggressive product features at the lowest costs, but the overall value proposition of a very sophisticated wholesaling force and very sophisticated retail distribution system. As we move forward, and the changes that we make, we'll be consistent with that philosophy, which is continuing to reduce risk from the insurance company standpoint, not providing the richest features, and combining a very good product with a good, customer value proposition with the needs of our shareholders from a risk perspective, and the significant capability that we had with our distribution organization.\nSuneet Kamath: Just last question on timing, when do you think you are going to be rolling out some of these new products?\nDennis Glass: Probably in the third quarter, in that range. Remember, again, we don't have to move as fast as other people have to move, because, again just take our withdrawal benefits. The [Rachet] has been 5% and others have had 10% or 8% or 7% or 6%, and so they've had to move more quickly and, again, they have moved back to where we are in many instances already. So if you think we are going slower than the competition, that's because we don't have as much need as some of the competitors to move as quickly.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James \u0026 Associates.\nSteven Schwartz: A couple of quickies and then more theoretical question. Fred, merger-related expenses, I believe we're done in the second quarter; is that correct?\nFred Crawford: We actually had a small amount of merger-related expenses in the period, Steven, but it is absolutely winding down. Total merger-related expenses in the quarter were just under $7 million. What I would say, though, and I'm glad you asked the question, is this, that as we talked about, we have put in place a fairly aggressive cost cutting program. Much of that is taking place in the second quarter, and so you would naturally have a level of restructuring charges that come through. So you will notice in our statistical supplement that we had pre-tax about $5 million of restructuring charges that came during the first quarter as we started to get going, but most of the notifications and actions were taking place in the second quarter. Our estimate right now is after-tax we would expect something in the neighborhood of $20 million or so of after-tax restructuring charges in the second quarter as our current estimate right now.\nSteven Schwartz: I think it was Dennis who said that he thought savings in the second half would be about $45 million on a GAAP basis, presumably not including the restructuring charge offset. Could we see that maybe in 2010?\nDennis Glass: We'll hold off on that projection for a little while. That number would be likely double, given the fact that most of it is coming in the second half. So, I would say quick answer to that is $90 million to $100 million.\nSteven Schwartz: And then a theoretical question. I think historically you've kind of targeted to 375 of RBC. You are talking today about 350. I'm wondering about your thinking is that that you are at these ratings and that's where you're going to stay and that's 350, or are you taking into account that VACARVM is going to move you there and it's simply changed an accounting as apposed to change in economics or may be both?\nDennis Glass: My view is that the 350% RBC is just a target that the company has meaning that that's what I think is commensurate with in and around the low AA-rated range of financial strength ratings across the agencies. This, of course, dependent upon the market environment that you are experiencing, so the intention of the company would be to watch the various ins and outs of what moves your capital up and down and try to take actions in such a way that we manage in and around that range. We will drift above it at times, as we did in the first quarter. We will drift below it depending on the timing of impairments and transactions that we look to take action on, but I do not have a VACARVM estimate in that target. That's something that we still have under review. We are heartened somewhat by the fact that we maintained pretty substantial assets that back our VA business. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, we ended the first quarter with hedge assets pretty considerably or well above that of the current statutory guidelines, but VACARVM will increase reserved. Those reserves do behave differently than the derivative valuations do due to interest rates and we'll have to monitor conditions, as we go forward and make adjustments accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Berg with Barclays Capital.\nEric Berg: Thanks and good morning to both of you, and to Jim. It sort of felt like in the March quarter that while there were many companies, several companies had liquidity issues. It sort of felt to me like Lincoln was scrambling, that even though everyone was in a similar operating environment, that somehow Lincoln was in a pinch and had to sort of borrow from here and take from there. We've heard have a lot about taking money from here, reinsurance, Federal Home Loan Bank. I suspect you are going to think that the use of the word scramble would be an unfair characterization and it's perfectly fine for you to say that, but, that's sort of how it's felt. What would be your view on that Dennis? The right characterization to the liquidity position and what happened to Lincoln during the quarter? And then I have a second question.\nDennis Glass: Yeah, Eric, it seemed that a couple of things sort of combined to focus on Lincoln's liquidity a little bit more than other companies, when we saw that happen, we immediately began to respond in the market place, with the comments and actions that we've been taking. I think the decision to upstream the dividends and just take this issue of the financial flexibility off the table for quite a number of years, probably helped to clear up in the minds of people what the real circumstance was. Fred's already mentioned why we've done that, and I can tell you that, I believe that liquidity is taken care of. We don't really have significant debt maturities, they run in the $200 million range for the next three or four years. So, we don't have anything on the horizon that's not manageable. The other thing is so, if you just say to yourself, look, they are taking care of financial issues at the holding company are in good shape and a lot of resources. We can now focus entirely on all of our efforts to be sure that even under our stress scenarios, that we have action that we can pull the trigger on to maintain adequate RBC. So, that's where our focus is as a management team. And, again, I'm quite confident that even under the stress situation that we will manage through the challenges of 2009 from the capital perspective.\nEric Berg: Thanks. My second question is much a narrower and technical one. Fred, you mentioned that during the quarter the non-performance risk, there was change in the addition to your GMWB liability related to the non-performance risk. Can you go over whether that was a benefit or a detriment and what the earnings impact would have been, you discussed this. I'm just hoping you can review it, what the earnings impact would have been absent that change? Thank you.\nFred Crawford: Yes. We refined our estimate really to lessen the sensitivity of the NPR to our particular spreads at the holding company level. On the view that insurance company liabilities are generally less sensitive to our credit default swap-type issues, at the holding company. And so that was our view and that's what gave rise to the change. Now, the reason the NPR was actually a negative in the quarter was really more volume-related, meaning that the overall size of the FAS133 liability actually came down in the quarter, due predominantly to interest rates and volatility coming down a bit, but mainly interest rates. So, we were applying the NPR to a smaller base and therefore ended up having the reduction. Now, had we not made the change, I mentioned that we would have taken a sizable gain. That gain would have been about $300 million in the quarter, had we not made the change. But, as we continue to refine our estimates and work within the accounting guidelines and what we think makes sense, as you look at the nature of the liabilities, we felt the refinements were good on our part, albeit a negative in the quarter.\nOperator: We go next to Mark Finkelstein with FPK.\nMark Finkelstein: I guess one follow-up question, just on the numbers, Fred. You walked through those, I guess, reasonably quickly, I just want to make sure I got these right. I think you said stat net income was negative $53 million, and that is with the benefit of the $150 million reinsurance gain. Would that mean that without that stat net income would have been negative 200 or do I have the numbers wrong?\nFred Crawford: Yes, the net income on the stat basis includes is the actual stat earnings generated naturally of the book of business recognizing carbon reduced earnings in the annuity line and strain from continued good production on the life side. But it also includes the impact of the ceding commission that comes in from the reinsurance transaction. And then what it brings it into the negative category is really all of the impairment activity, the roughly $250 million odd worth of impairment taken in the quarter on securities. There also tends not to be as greater tax offset to those impairments when you bring them through on a stat basis. So that in part, weighs it down.\nMark Finkelstein: I just want to understand the holding company a little bit, and maybe just help in terms of reconciliation, thinking, about, outstanding CP. How much, if any, intercompany borrowings exist? And then also what is the cash of the holding company? Really what I'm trying to get at is what are those balances and how do you get those down to the $500 million, by the end of the second quarter? And if there is needed cash coming to get you there where does that come from?\nFred Crawford: Sure, it's actually a good time to walk through this, because just yesterday, in fact, we retired a pretty sizable portion of the so-called c-puff commercial paper, this would be the government commercial paper. I think we retired something in the neighborhood of $300 million of that. So, in other words we are starting to settle in to or towards more normalized levels. As we sit here today, we have about $270 million of commercial paper outstanding, about $60 million of which is under the government program. So, we've been actively issuing in the tier two commercial paper market between $200 and $300 million, pretty routinely. It took us about a couple of months or so to really initiate a new list of investors, requalify, if you will, investors in the tier 2 commercial paper and we have been quite successful in placing that paper. It tends to be in smaller chunks, but you can also issue it fairly long, 30, 60 days and rolling it without trouble at this point. We also though have borrowed from our internal CMA or really our overnight sweep accounts and the liquidity accounts that we have across the company to the tune of $350 million or so. Now, if you do the math on that, that brings you upwards of a little north of roughly $600 million, and as I mentioned, we have the second tranche of our ordinary dividend coming later in the quarter at about $100 million. That will then bring you down into the short-term position around $500 million. Now, a couple of things I want to comment on here. We are a large company that naturally has sizable ins and outs on any given day from our cash flow perspective. We have interest payments that are quarterly and semiannually. We collect dividends from our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. We also have tax proceeds that are moving in or moving out of the company depending on our tax position. So, on any given day, these liquidity positions will move around. When we as a company talk about our liquidity position at around $500 million, that's what we believe to be more of the steady state, managing of our liquidity position on a go-forward basis.\nMark Finkelstein: Okay. Great. Finally, you mentioned that, pretty far along the way, a securitization structure. Is that an external transaction or is that internal?\nDennis Glass: External in the sense that we would be working with a third party or third party investors to secure that financing.\nFred Crawford: One other thing while I have you here on the topic of this cash management account or cash sweep account. Recognize that we have got several subsidiaries that participate in that arrangement, upwards of 10 to 15 different subsidiaries that will park their daily liquidity and overnight liquidity or extended liquidity into that facility. I say that only because it's not always the case, particularly when we are not leaning very heavily on it that we are borrowing from Lincoln Life Insurance company of Indiana. Now, granted most of the subsidiaries are much smaller, and our core insurance company would be the largest source of liquidity potentially, if necessary, but it's not always the case that we are directly borrowing from Lincoln Life.\nDennis Glass: I would just add to that, that the sweep account is exactly what it says. It collects funds that we would otherwise invest overnight, and a company our size is likely to have a couple hundred million dollars of funds every night. So, if you subtract a couple hundred funds of float that we have every night from the $500 million, we only really need $300 million from the commercial paper market to handle the $500 million. I would also say and reinforce that the reduction in interest expense due to the debt reductions that we have made, the additional comment about the $400 million of holding company needs, really suggests there shouldn't be any pressure at all on that $500 million getting higher for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: For our next question we go to Darin Arita with Deutsche Bank.\nDarin Arita: Thank you. I guess the first question is for Fred. You had mentioned that the dividends coming out of the insurance subs is really based on you seeing some excess capital there. What's your estimate as to where the excess capital is for your onshore and offshore insurance subsidiaries?\nFred Crawford: The way I would describe excess capital at the moment is, if you describe it as having a target of 350, and recognizing the dividend actions we have taken in the second quarter, what we have effectively done Darin is shift that access capital to the holding company. So, while you could argue that we have taken the excess capital that is defined by risk-based capital cushion, and moved it into a delevering position at the holding company, where we would have excess capital in that regard. So that I think is really the way to think about it. I think right now we have to be conscious of the steps that we can take on the capital front if we were to see continued capital deterioration due to realized losses and impairments in the general account. So, that's the way I would describe the excess capital position at the moment. The dialogue around excess capital across the industry frankly is, it is really only one you can have when bouncing it up against stress conditions for the general account in the market. So, what you are finding with the rating agencies, and I think implied in some of their actions is not really the absolute RBC, but rather what that RBC looks like when bounced up against potential loss conditions. I think where we have tended to hold up reasonably will, albeit with some downward pressure is our overall general account, our diversity and quality, and then the risk manager practices on the annuity business.\nDarin Arita: That's helpful. How do we think about it for the offshore reinsurers. You can take the [$300 million] out there.\nDennis Glass: The offshore captive had built up pretty substantial asset value with their derivatives position, and we ended up in really an excess asset position as we came off the year end and into the first quarter, primarily a result of being over hedged on our income benefits. We had taken more of a pure economic 133 derivative like approach to income benefits, and as you know, there's a very real mortality element to that which brings about more of an SOP type reserving regime on that business. So, that afforded us the opportunity to monetize some of the hedge assets, and move that excess capital or excess asset position out of Barbados to pay down debt. Again, simply a decision as to where best we want to hold that capital.\nDarin Arita: Okay. Thanks. One for Dennis, I guess. On the variable annuities, can you talk about the rationale for Lincoln continuing to de-risk? I mean, based on Lincoln's comments, it sounded like the hedge programs has performed well. The hedge assets are in line with the economic liabilities and also Lincoln didn't provide us benefits that are [right] as the competitors and now the competitors are scaling back more in line with Lincoln. Why does Lincoln have to make any changes?\nDennis Glass: The market is going to permit changes and the competition, again, that we have always been from feature standpoint, less risk, the competition is coming in and, again, when you step back and look at the total franchise value of what enables us to be successful with the sales of variable annuities for all of our other products, it's the combination of a lot of things, distribution, product, and the like. So, we have the opportunity to de-risk the product because the industry is moving in that direction and we're going to take advantage of it.\nDarin Arita: Okay. Is that any statement on your view of the profitability of the business that you wrote?\nDennis Glass: It is a statement on the fact that we want to reduce the tail risk and that we'll take some reduction in the expected internal rate of return on the product in order to eliminate or not eliminate, but reduce the tail risk. So it's a rebalancing of expected returns and expected risk.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.\nTom Gallagher: I just wanted to follow-up on the holding company to make sure I have the numbers right, I guess for Fred. Fred, the $600 million of balances between [CP] and the internal CMA borrowings, should we compare that to the $700 million of dividends that were taken, so you would essentially have a net cash balance of $100 million or have you used some of the cash from the dividends to date?\nFred Crawford: The current CP and CMA balance is after having moved the $300 million out of Barbados and roughly $300 million out of Lincoln Life. We have another $100 million of the ordinary dividend to move in and that's what we'll bring that a little over $600 million down to a little over $500 million. We don't really hold what I would call much idle cash. We do have some corporate securities that we hold at the holding company, but we really manage to a cash flow neutral environment at the holding company, and that's how we manage the liquidity. Does that answer your question?\nTom Gallagher: Yes, it does. You have used up the dividends to pay it down and you will have a rough balance of $500 million between the CP and the CMA?\nFred Crawford: That's right.\nDennis Glass: Let me add, over the last five years, we have always borrowed short in the marketplace, probably north of the $500 million. So this is not unusual the way we manage our investment portfolios and our long/short positions and long-term rates versus short-term rates to be comfortable with the $500 million short-term position. Again, it's somewhat less than we have held on average over the years.\nTom Gallagher: So, as we think about it prospectively, you have $500 million there, which I believe you can go upwards of $1 billion of borrowing from the subs if need be.\nDennis Glass: Right.\nTom Gallagher: Then prospectively we should be thinking about $300 million of annual interest expense plus an extra $250 million of debt due in 2010?\nFred Crawford: Yeah, and your interest expense at the holding company is supported by normal dividend flows out of the life insurance company, surplus net interest payments out of the life insurance company, and income or dividend flows from non-regulated subs like the UK, Delaware etcetera.\nDennis Glass: I don't think we'll have to dividend off much more than $150 million or so from the subsidiaries over the next couple of years to maintain that $500 million.\nTom Gallagher: That is helpful. This is a little further out, but I just want to understand the mechanics. I believe your $2 million of LOCs mature in 2011. A lot can obviously change between now and then, but if we assume debt markets are still frozen by then, how would that play out? Would you have to pay those down or I believe those support a Triple X reserves. So it would just be a stack capital strain of some sort or can you expand on that a bit?\nFred Crawford: The letter of credit facility that matures in 2011 allows you to extend your letters of credit out of 2012. So it allows a bit more time on the letters of credit. Now what we have to do is really manage to the various alternatives that are available to support the redundancy going forward or any excess reserves financing we need. That would include probably reduced capacity on letters of credit. Going forward, although we would have to see how the markets play out. Longer term securitization transaction and our product modifications that would hopefully help the reserve carry as we go forward. So right now, as a company, we're very actively engaged in looking at the planning exercise around how best to finance these reserves going forward. Now, at the end of the day, if you have to carry more reserves, the other aspect of this is you simply need to do the kind of internal work, actuarial work to show that you are carrying excess reserves back in your business and that may be weighing down on your RBC. So I think ultimately at the end of the day, that actuarial work on what the appropriate economic reserves are on the whole remains important irrespective of how you finance it. I might also add that you got to be thinking about product, structure and pricing as well, in terms of the outright costs of that financing.\nTom Gallagher: Fred, just one last follow-up. Would you have an estimate of what the RBC strain that was relieved related to the $2 billion, just even ballpark would be helpful?\nFred Crawford: Well, over the course of the last couple of years, we have done reserve securitizations between $200 and $300 million type range using letters of credit or securitization type vehicles. So, I would say on average, it's probably helped out our risk-based capital, in and around 20 to 30 points on annualized bases from what otherwise would be greater strain. Obviously, it depends on the size of the reserve securitizations you do. We've done larger and we've done smaller.\nDennis Glass: I would just add to that, I know that you are looking forward a little bit, but remember, we are doing these reserve transactions in today's markets. And the reason we are able to do that is because they are generally secured by the excess reserves in the form of future cash flows. So, these are secured financings and that's why they are even doable today.\nTom Gallagher: So Dennis, you are still able to do those types of deals in this kind of market. So we should be thinking about, although these sound large in the future based on today's market, you'd still be able to essentially roll those over?\nDennis Glass: As I said in my comments, if they are smaller, they are more expensive and they are more challenging to execute on. But, we continue to review and look at ideas and alternatives for where to execute them and how best to execute them. So, clearly the market is a bit different right now, of course to do these things. But, our approach is to string these out, do them in modest size, recognizing that its likely markets will recover and pricing will improve overtime.\nOperator: With that Mr. Sjoreen, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.\nJim Sjoreen: Thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Good set of questions. As always, we will be able to take your questions on our investor relations line at 1-800-237-2920 or via email at www.investorrelations@lnc.com. Again, thanks for all your time today and have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call. Thank you for your participation.
HUM~2009~1~226~1087~4/28/2009~.026613096~.033687584~.076339804~.14238971~-3.099165~-3.4577096~-3.394954~-3.2836969~1~Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, my name is Laurie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Humana First Quarter 2009 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)  At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations Regina Nethery.  Please go ahead.\nRegina Nethery: Good morning and thank you for joining us.  In a moment Mike McCallister, Humana’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Bloem, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will briefly discuss highlights from our first quarter 2009 results, as well as comments on our earnings outlook. Following these prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for a question-and-answer session with industry analysts.  Joining Mike and Jim for the Q\u0026A session will be Jim Murray, our Chief Operating Officer, and Chris Todoroff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. We encourage the investing public and media to listen in to both managements prepared remarks and the related Q\u0026A with analysts.  This call is being recorded for replay purposes.  That replay will be available on the Investor Relations page of Humana’s website humana.com later today.  This call is also being simulcast via the internet, along with a virtual slide presentation.  For those of you who have company firewall issues and cannot access the live presentation, an Adobe version of the slides has been posted to the Investor Relations section of Humana’s website. Before we begin our discussion, I need to cover some other items.  First our cautionary statement:  Certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially.  Investors are advised to read the detailed risk factors discussed in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  All of our SEC filings are available via the Investor Relations page of Humana’s website, as well as on the SEC’s website. Additionally, investors are advised to read Humana’s first quarter 2009 earnings press release issued this morning, April 27, 2009.  This press release and other historical financial news releases are also available on our Investor Relations website.  Any references made to earnings per share or EPS in this mornings call refer to diluted earnings per common share. Finally, one point of clarification on this morning’s press release, on Page 9, the Government segment benefit ratio guidance point is that to the entire segment so includes Medicare, Medicaid, and Military Services.  The Medicare benefit ratio guidance point below it is that for Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP combined. With that I will turn the call over to Mike McCallister.\nMike McCallister: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.  Today Humana reported first quarter earnings of $1.22 per share, $0.07 above the midpoint of the guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 we shared with you in our fourth quarter 2008 earnings release, and significantly higher than the $0.47 per share we earned in the first quarter of last year.  These favorable results were due primarily to year-over-year improved performance in our Medicare prescription drug plans as we effectively addressed the issues we encountered in 2008. Additionally, the quarter saw solid operating performance in both of our business segments, Government and Commercial, which we anticipate to continue through out 2009.  Consequently, we also announced today an increase in our full year 2009 EPS guidance, now at $6.10 to $6.20 per share, up from our previous guidance of $5.90 to $6.10. Given that our 2008 results were adversely impacted by the PDP event and not indicative of the strength of our operations, we’re watching the two year compounded annual growth rate as a more relevant measure of how we’re adding shareholder value.  Based upon our updated guidance this morning, the two-year CAGR using the midpoint of that guidance is 12%. In the next few minutes I will offer comments on the specific performance and outlook of our Government and Commercial segments and give you an update on how we’re making measurable progress in reducing costs and improving health outcomes for Medicare Beneficiaries through clinical initiatives associated with our Medicare Advantage offerings.  I will also update you on a significant customer service milestone we achieved in the first quarter, the launch of a major Humana initiative in conjunction with 20 members of congress designed to reduce childhood obesity and on the continued development and uptake of Availity our ground breaking provider portal that is fast becoming a national model for IT connectivity in healthcare. Let’s begin with our government segment.  As many of you are aware the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the final 2010 Medicare Advantage Rates on April 6, with an effective rate decrease for the sector of 4% to 5%.  We will have to address this rate change by increasing member premiums, reducing benefits, or some combination there of, as we file our bids for 2010.  At the same time, we will continue to pursue our successful cost reduction and outcomes enhancing strategies, including care coordination and disease management, to help mitigate the adverse effects of this rate reduction on our Medicare Advantage members. As our 2010 bids are due the first Monday in June, work is already underway to make strategic changes designed to not only keep our plans competitive versus the combination of original Medicare with a Medigap policy, but also to be well positioned against the competition within our sector.  With our knowledge of senior consumer behavior, together with our product design and actuarial depth, we believe we can effectively design products that address the shortfall in rates while still providing the solid value proposition for seniors. Nevertheless, Humana and the industry, in conjunction with congressional leaders, continue to work for further consideration of the DOC fix since we believe the related CMS technical adjustment for 2010 will cause the nations seniors to experience significant disruption to their benefit structures only to have much if not all of that reversed back in 2011. Specifically, we have been working with a bipartisan group of US senators who recently sent a letter to CMS expressing their concern about the Medicare payment cuts for 2010, along with a letter of concern from their chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee.  Among other reasons the senators are concerned because of the continued inclusion in the rates of a scheduled 21% reduction in what physicians are paid to treat Medicare beneficiaries.  As those senators pointed out in their letter, it is very unlikely that congress would ever allow these lower physician payments to take effect.  In past years Congress has always enacted a DOC fix and we believe it will again this year. In fact, the Senates budget resolution includes a provision with the goal of protecting Medicare Advantage enrollees from premium increase in benefit reductions in their Medicare Advantage Plans as a result of CMS not taking into account the likelihood that Congress will address the physician payment formula.  If Congress does act to address this issue in a timely fashion, CMS has acknowledged they will work with Congress to consider options for addressing it as part of the 2010 Medicare payment rates. Additionally, the senators concerns are shared with more than 800,000 Medicare Advantage members who belong to an industry wide grass roots coalition.  These seniors are calling, writing, and meeting with members of Congress across the country.  They also participated in numerous Medicare Advantage community meetings during the recent congressional recess. So how might our products look in 2010?  While we are still in the midst of our annual market-by-market, product-by-product benefit design review, this Slide gives an indication of what seniors in Des Moines, Iowa, for example, might see if we change only member premiums in 2010.  As you look at the value when compared to the purchase of a Medigap policy, is still quite clear. Turning to Medicare Advantage membership for 2009, we expect the addition of approximately 50,000 net new Medicare Advantage members this year.  Sales of our network-based plans continue to be strong, with 61% of our membership now in either PPO or HMO products, including 87,000 of our Private Fee-For-Service members who chose to move into one of those network products for this year.  With over 80 % of our Private Fee-For-Service members already in areas served by network products, a percent we expect to increase as we further build out networks, we are well positioned for the changes scheduled for 2011 that will have the effect of triggering the replacement of Private Fee-For-Service products with PPO and HMO network based products for most of the nation. I said earlier that Humana continues to make progress reducing costs and improving health outcomes for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.  This work has positive implications, not just for our members, but for the Medicare program as a whole.  As we’ve pointed out many times, original Medicare, which lacks any sort of cost controls and functions essentially as a claims bank factory, is headed rapidly for insolvency.  By contrast, Medicare Advantage features care coordination, case management, disease management, predictive modeling, comprehensive wellness services, transplant coordination, and more, all of which have the measurable effect of lowering costs. Many in congress understand the capabilities being rolled out through Medicare Advantage are critical to the viability of the program and must be applied to the total Medicare population over time.  This roll out is currently being financed through the payment methodology for Medicare Advantage plans.  Many know the good work done by MA plans must be fostered by health reform and not lost in a misguided concept of returning to growing reliance on an out of control old Medicare program.  We continue to make measurable progress against Humana’s initial goals of having medical costs 15% below traditional Medicare.  The next couple of slides illustrate a few of the opportunities. The positive effects of coordinating care on the cost of inpatient acute admissions, including readmissions, and emergency room visits are graphically shown in this comparison of utilization for original Medicare versus that in our Medicare Advantage plans.  Savings of nearly $345.00 per beneficiary on inpatient admissions and $30.00 per member on emergency room visits add up quickly when you’re serving millions of seniors.  This translated to savings of $301 million for inpatient acute admissions and $26 million for emergency room visits related to the seniors served by Humana plans. Another important aspect of our Medicare cost reduction efforts is finding, assessing, and contracting with efficient physicians, thus the cost of physician services in Humana Medicare Advantage plans is driven lower as the network focuses on only the most efficient providers.  Importantly, this is accomplished while offering a robust network to our members. At a time when the new administration will be required very soon to seek a long-term answer to the Medicare funding problem, we’re ready to help with a proven cost and care solution that members love.  Satisfaction rates for Medicare Advantage plans are well over 80% with only 1% to 2% of seniors leaving Medicare Advantage to go back to original Medicare.  This is further evidence of a value proposition. We believe that we may also have some opportunity to pick up market share as participants exit the market when the product becomes more operationally challenging for them. The combination of our Medicare cost management model, administrative productivity, and strong networks position us to have a viable Medicare Advantage offering for many years to come.  At the same time, we are also strengthening our Medicare Supplement product portfolio to round out our comprehensive menu of product options for seniors. Our view of Medicare has not changed, nor have the facts.  Healthcare provided through the old Medicare program is wasteful, not coordinated, and unaffordable for many seniors.  The Medicare Trust Fund will be insolvent in the not too distant future.  We must as a country ensure the long-term viability of the program.  Seniors aging into the program seek value and are more accustomed to coordinated care plans.  Coordinated care can and does have a positive impact on health and wellness and lowers medical costs. The depth and breadth of our Medicare Operations Team will continue to position us well in this dynamic environment. Now turning to our other government business, TRICARE, we continue to anticipate that the Department of Defense will make its TRICARE award announcement for the T3 five-year contracts sometime in the second quarter.  This announcement would involve all three regions, south where we are the incumbent bidder, as well as the north and west regions.  In the interim, as you know, we have signed agreements with the Department of Defense for additional option periods with the first extending through March 2010 and two more six-month extension periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Department of Defense. Turning to our Commercial segment, we have been closely monitoring the impact the volatile economy is having on our Commercial segment operations.  Reductions in force have caused corresponding membership losses in our Small Group business to be substantially higher than we previously expected, even while the employer remains our customer.  However, our solid reputation in the Individual business through Humana I is resulting in some of these members who are enrolling in our individual plans.  On a full-year basis we expect our Commercial Medical membership to be down $150 to $175, 000 versus the end of 2008, reflecting both the loss of a few larger ASO accounts that we reported last quarter, as well as the impact of in-group attrition I just mentioned. With investment income also expected to be lower than we previously anticipated, a topic Jim Bloem will discuss in his remarks, we now expect Commercial pre-tax income to be in the range of $225 to $235 million.  I do want to note, however, that our 2008 Commercial segment earnings are still anticipated to increase 10% to 15% over the prior year despite lower net investment income for 2009. Before closing, let me update you on three developments that extend Humana’s industry leadership and service, health and wellness and health IT connectivity.  Each gets at the heart of supplying solutions to the biggest health policy problems facing our nation, cost, and the growing numbers of Americans with preventable chronic conditions and the lack of IT connectivity. First I will discuss customer service.  In a recent polling by JD Power, Humana has become the top rated health plan in a number of regions around our geographic footprint.  These results are a testament to the growing effectiveness of our company wide Perfect Service initiative which emphasizes engaging our members proactively and seeking to anticipate and then exceed their individual expectations. Second are Health and Wellness Initiatives around childhood obesity.   This fast growing epidemic accounts for $14 billion in direct medical expenses each year.  Obesity is one of five preventable, chronic diseases that when taken together consume 70% of the nations healthcare bill.  Now we are doing something about it.  With the US Capital as a backdrop, the Humana foundation on March 31, held a news conference to launch the American HorsePower Challenge in conjunction with 20 members of Congress, 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans.  2000 elementary and middle school children in districts represented by the congressmen will compete in a unique exercise video game designed to attack the epidemic of childhood obesity.  This innovative exergaming approach translates actual physical activity, steps walked, measured by a computerized pedometer into an online race amongst schools in the same congressional district and among the districts.  The 20 members of congress are servings as honorary participants in the challenge.  Their own steps will be counted in their states or districts total. In a Louisville, Kentucky pilot program students burned over 470,000 calories and walked nearly 13.5 million steps, the equivalent of approximately 6,400 miles.  Some important behavior changes were noted in these students, specifically 62% exercise at lunch, 45% started eating healthier, and 53% exercise with their family.  The program is constant with Humana’s long held belief that supplying consumers with actionable information empowers them to take control over their own health.  What HorsePower Challenge represents is the convergence of that actionable information gathered in a unique way through technology and the knowledge that kids are big consumers of gaming.  The result is a contemporary approach to wellness through measurable behavior change. Finally, Health Information Technology commonly referred to as HIT.  The Obama administration has committed $19 billion in stimulus funds to foster Healthcare IT connectivity demonstrating the importance it places on such initiatives. We are proud to say that our Availity joint venture is playing an increasingly important role, serving as a model for the long-held dream of a robust, nationwide, interoperable Healthcare IT network. Since it pioneered multi-payer IT connectivity for providers in Florida eight years ago, Availity has expanded its reach and serves more than 50,000 doctor’s offices, 1,000 hospitals, and 1,000 health plans nationwide.  Active in all 50 states, Availity has enhanced its capabilities to include the creation of payer based health records and real-time claims adjudication.  The Availity venue is now used by all of the major health plans, public and private, for profit and not for profit, with one of our more sizable competitors recently buying into the joint venture that Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida began in 2001. The administrative simplicity for the provider community Availity provides is unmatched and we believe will continue to result in higher transaction volume going through this portal. In addition, Availity was recently selected as a vendor of choice by the Virginia Health Exchange Network, an association of health plans and health systems in that state and Availity is contracted with a Florida agency for Healthcare Administration to implement a new demonstration product that will give physicians and patients access to Medicaid claims based electronic health records as well. For 2009 Availity is expected to handle more than $600 million transactions or approximately 10% of the total transaction volume in the US.  In addition the ongoing expansion of the networks real-time health information exchange now includes e-prescribing in Texas and Florida with more states scheduled to be added later this year. Why does this matter?  For years we’ve discussed with you the power of actionable information at the consumer and provider level.  Availity is essentially the real-time highway for the delivery of that information.  The result is speed, accuracy, higher quality, and of course, lower cost.  That has been the clear impact on the rest of the economy as information technology has spread and will be in healthcare too. As you can see, Human is active on many fronts and we expect the remainder of 2009 to extend the success we had in the first quarter with our full-year EPS now projected to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.20.  Despite the uncertainties of politics and the global economy, we believe Humana is particularly well positioned for success in future years as well.  Our direct to consumer approach to sales and our emphasis on the power of the consumer to choose, finance, and use health benefits with confidence positions us well in an economic climate where the impact of rising healthcare costs, reflected in insurance premiums, will grow ever starker. The flexibility and resiliency we’ve shown over our 48-year history in anticipating and adapting to change now deeply a part of the DNA in both our company leadership and just as importantly our associates is already bearing fruit as we continue to incorporate the adjustments that the future will demand.  Consistent with our legacy of successfully transforming our selves through a number of businesses with health always at the center, we are now strategically broadening our scope beyond health benefits.  We are supporting the health of individuals and communities.  Over the next few years our emphasis increasingly will be on providing opportunities for our members to improve their health in ways that are measurable, that offer rewards, that take advantage of new media tools like exergames and social networks, that help sustain the planet, and are just plain fun.  If we can help people get and stay healthy over time, they will save money and the system will prosper.  In the meantime, the operational discipline that produced our first quarter results bodes well for our own ability to continue to succeed. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim Bloem.\nJim Bloem: Thanks Mike and good morning everyone.  Let’s begin by recapping our first quarter results.  As Mike mentioned we are pleased to report that our earnings per share exceeded the mid-point of our expectations for the first quarter by $0.07.  The primary driver was our Medicare operating performance as both the Medicare Advantage and the stand-alone PDP businesses performed very well.  As noted in the slide, the quarter also included $0.03 per share of adverse impact from the lower than anticipated investment income due to circumstances I will discuss in a few minutes. My comments this morning will focus on the three most noteworthy factors impacting both our first quarter results and our increased full year EPS guidance range.  These three items are first, better than expected Medicare performance; second, reduced investment income due to lower interest rate expectations; and third, decreased Small Group Commercial membership.  I will detail each of these factors in the next several slides, but first let’s look at our full year anticipated earnings per share. As Mike mentioned, we are pleased to raise our 2009 EPS guidance from a range of $5.90 to $6.10 to a range of $6.10 to $6.20, an increase of $0.15 using the mid points.  The following three factors enable us to confidently raise our full year EPS guidance: First, the primary reason is our improved outlook which builds on our improved outlook for Medicare, which builds on our first quarter Medicare performance. That’s reflected in both higher than previously expected revenues per member and lower than expected benefit expenses. Second, slightly offsetting the full year Medicare improvement is a projected decrease in Commercial Small Group membership as the year progresses. Third, we also now anticipate our full year 2009 investment income will be lower than our previous guidance by $55 million or $0.20 per share. Let’s review each of these changes and expectations in greater detail starting with the changes to our Medicare forecast. This morning we lowered our expected 2009 overall benefit ratio by about 75 basis points at the mid points.  That ratio is now expected to be in the range of 82.5% to 83.5%.  As I mentioned, we are seeing improvements in both the benefit expense and the premium components of the overall benefit ratio for Medicare.  Changes in the benefit expense expectations primarily relate to the stand-alone PDP expenses, while changes in our premium expectations primarily relate to Medicare Advantage. As we continually have monitored our PDP claims expenses we have been pleased to note that each of our three plans has performed better than expected with the Standard Plan doing particularly well.  Higher uses of generics across all three plans have helped drive these lower than forecasted expenses. Now with respect to Medicare Advantage premiums, much of the improvement stems from higher risk adjusted premiums.  In last quarters call we mentioned that the risk scores of the members that we acquired for 2009 were not significantly different than those for 2008.  That fact has not changed, rather though, the primary driver of changes in risk scores is an improvement in provider documentation for those Medicare Advantage members that we have had over a longer period of time.  Note, that the longer the members tenure with us, the more likely it is that the risk score accurately reflects the members health status. CMS used March as one of its two cut-off months for analyzing member risk score data to adjust planned premiums later in the year.  Accordingly, we also update our risk adjustment premium accrual analyses using the provider data submitted to CMS by the cut-off date.  Based on that work, we adjusted our risk adjustment premium accruals to ensure that revenue was recorded properly.  Consequently, our first quarter results include these updated accruals, as does our forecast for the remainder of 2009. Turning next to the Commercial segment, this morning we lowered our full year commercial pre-tax income guidance by approximately $50 million.   As shown on the slide, about $35 million or 70% of this reduction consists of our lowered outlook for investment income, which I will detail in a moment.  The other issue impacting the commercial business is our revised outlook for Small Group membership, which we now see as declining by 90,000 to 110,000 members by the end of this year.  As Mike mentioned, it has become clear that the prolonged recession is having a more significant adverse impact on smaller employers than we previously estimated.  Virtually all of the $15 million detailed on the operations line on the slide can be attributed to lower expected Small Group membership. Finally, our secular trend components, which as usual are detailed in this morning’s press release, continue to track with our expectations.  In the aggregate, we expect secular trends of 6% to 7%, however, if you include the impact of benefit buy downs, growth in high deductible health plans, the migration of groups to more cost effective networks, and other business mix changes, the trend decreases by another 3%, resulting in net trends of 3% to 4%, which are in line with those we shared with you in last quarters call and release. Now, with respect to investment income, the first quarter investment income was $69.5 million versus $90 million in the first quarter of 2008.  That is a decrease of $20.5 million or 22.8%.  Despite our roughly $750 million or 10.7% year-over-year increase in the average invested balance, we continue to struggle with investment returns for the following three reasons:  First, continued extremely low cash and cash equivalent yields; second, a relative scarcity of fixed income investments, which meet our investment criteria.  This results in a greater than desired portion of our average invested balance remaining in cash and cash equivalents. Third, the Federal Reserve’s March 18 announced commitment to purchase $1.1 trillion 150 million dollars of US government securities with maturities of between two and ten years by the end of September. It’s important to note that each of these reasons reflects a lower general level of interest rates rather than any specific credit issues.  The first two reasons caused our first quarter investment income to be $8 million or $0.03 per share, less than we expected 90 days ago with an additional $11 million or $0.04 per share reduction expected over the remaining nine months of this year. The third reason, which is termed by the Fed as quantitative easing is expected to lower our investment by an additional $36 million or $0.13 per share over the last three quarters of the year.  As a result the yields on the two to ten portion of the yield curve have tightened up by 50 to 60 basis points.  Accordingly, today we have reduced our 2009 investment income guidance range by a total of $55 million or $0.20 per share to $270 million to $290 million. Our $7.4 billion investment portfolio continues to benefit from broad diversification and appropriate duration, ample liquidity, and high credit quality.  At March 31 we had approximately $230 million of net unrealized losses on investments, which is the same amount we had at December 31.  As of April 23 our total net unrealized loss is decreased to approximately $165 million.  The $65 million or 28% improvement over March 31 reflects, among other things, the Fed’s quantitative easing that I mentioned a few minutes ago. Now as was the case in the last two quarters, you can get further detail on our portfolio composition from the statistical pages of this morning’s press release. Turning to the balance sheet, our days in claims payable declined 4.8 days when compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  This slide, which is again taken from the statistical pages of this morning’s press release, highlights the key items which impact the change and compares them with the first quarter of 2008.  In short, none of the decline was indicative of reserve releases or any changes in our consistent reserving practices. A summary of the major components of the decline are as follows:  1.9 days of the 4.8 days relate to timing, specifically the cut off for our pharmacy payment and process claims out the door.  Second, another 0.7 days relates to the faster processing of claims inventory.  Note that our days claims on hand were 4.2 at the end of the quarter, a near record low, and that reduction in days claims on hand was accomplished even while we continue to add more membership volume to our core Medicare processing platform, along with rolling the Medicare and Order of St Francis Medical membership acquired in 2008 to our core platform on January 1st. Finally, another two days was the result in the expense component of the days in claims table computations while the liability itself remained flat.  This mismatch occurred twice in the first quarter days in claims payable computation.  The first of these expenses versus liability mismatches occurs annually for the Part D component of our MAPD benefit.  Since Part D deductibles reset on January 1st and are front-end loaded in terms of the plans responsibility, the first quarter expense is higher than the fourth quarter’s expense. You will note that we also experienced this same affect in days in claims payable in the first quarter of 2008 and as well, in the first quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2009 this resulted in a sequential decline in days in claims payable of 1.1 of those two days, of those last two days I just mentioned. A second expense versus liability mismatch in the first quarter days in claims payable computation occurred this quarter in connection with our Cariten acquisition.  The expenses associated with Cariten members increased simply due to the timing of the acquisition, which was on November 1 of 2008.  This timing resulted in only two months of expense in the fourth quarter while a full three months was, of course, in the first quarter of ‘09.  That resulted in a sequential decline in days of claims payable of 0.9 days.  The remaining 0.2 days of the decline reflects normal fluctuation in the days in claims payable metric.   Again, we remain comfortable that our reserve levels are conservative and appropriate. Turning last to capital and liquidity, as demonstrated by the following 4 points, we continue to both have and prudently conserve ample capital and liquidity in these continuing uncertain times. First, we are reaffirming our 2009 cash flows from operations guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.  The primary driver for the full year increase over 2008 is the expected increase in 2009 net income.  As was the case in 2008, we expect most of the total 2009 operating cash flows to occur in the second half of the year. Second, we continue to retain $750 million of availability under our $1 billion revolving bank credit agreement.  Our bank credit facility remains effective until July 2011, after which the earliest issue of our senior notes matures in June of 2016. Third, our March 31, 2009 debt to total capitalization ratio was 29.3% and our target range remains in the 25% to 30% range. Finally, we continue to carry significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital in surplus in our state regulated operating subsidiaries.  We are pleased to note that last week all of our parent and subsidiary credit ratings were affirmed with a stable outlook by Standard \u0026 Poor’s.   Our parent company rating is BBB. Our continued expectation is that we will be able to a dividend at least $500 million from the subsidiaries to the parent in 2009 versus the $296 million that we dividended in 2008.  In addition, we expect capital contributions to the operating subsidiaries to be less than the $243 million that we contributed in 2008. As usual, we will update these amounts with our second quarter earnings conference call in early August, after our discussions with the respective State Departments of Insurance and all the credit rating agencies are completed. To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and the resulting increase in our full year earnings per share guidance of $6.10 to $6.20.  We continue to build on our organizational experience and new processes to improve the operating performance of both our business segments.  As we move toward mid-year 2009 the operating discipline and financial strength of Humana have never been greater. With that, we will open the phone lines for questions.  We request that each caller ask only two questions in fairness to those still waiting in the queue.  Operator will you please introduce the first caller.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.\nTom Carroll: I have a two-part question on Medicare as it relates to your Private Fee-For-Service to network product transition.   First, Private Fee declines have been fully offset by increases in network products.  Is there any correlation between your current Private Fee-For-Service enrollments switching over to, so Humana Private Fee to a Humana PPO type product?  Can you give us some kind of metric on that? Secondly, how do you think about this transition in 2010? Then maybe you could give us some high level commentary on 2011 also.  So, is there going to be a big push to make the transition in 2010, or is that going to be left really more to 2011?\nJim Murray: The net plan-to-plan changes that we experienced this past open enrollment period were around 87,000 members.  We purposely try to create a product continuum that encourages folks to go from the Private Fee-For-Service to the network based options, be it regional PPO, local PPO, or HMOs.  We saw some good movement this past open enrollment period and we anticipate we’ll see increasing levels of movement in 2010 and 2011.  We feel very well positioned for the CMS rule regarding the elimination of the Private Fee-For-Service on January 1 and we’re very pleased with how this is all beginning to set up for us.\nTom Carroll: So increasing levels in 2010, maybe it is too early to say right now in terms of your strategy, in terms of bidding for next year, but is it going to be more so in 2010 than 2011?\nJim Murray: I would anticipate that 2010 would be slightly higher than 2011.  2011, as I sit here now, we are obviously in the process of going through the market-by-market evaluation of what your benefits and premiums are going to look like.  My goal and our goal will be to try to get as much done in 2010 as possible with 2011 being the finalization of that process.  Again, we saw some nice movement this past open enrollment period and as we create our product continuums market-by-market that will be a major goal.\nTom Carroll: That’s very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles Boorady with Citi Investment Research.\nCharles Boorady: I am wondering how much of the impact in your Medicare Advantage loss ratio expected improvement this year is coming from the revenue benefit of the risk score issue that you discussed versus an improvement in underlying cost trends or other factors?\nMike McCallister: Charles, I mentioned two things, I mentioned the PDP and that was lowering benefit expenses and of course, your question again suggesting the Medicare risk adjustment.  The two things together were probably about $0.10 in the first quarter and they’re about a 3:2 ratio, so again, we kind of expect that to play out through the year.\nCharles Boorady: Okay and again, you underlying cost trend assumptions though, are they unchanged versus what you thought when you [interposing].\nMike McCallister: Yes.\nCharles Boorady: Okay, I have it. Then in terms of looking out to 2010, you mentioned the 4% to 5% cut that you hope to have mitigated, but assuming it goes through, if we were to assume it goes through and trying to assess what the impact will be in 2010, do you have any information that you can share with us to help us make our own estimates of what the impact would be?  For example, maybe the sensitivity of your MA demand growth this year in light of your imposing new member paid premiums this year, how sticky the enrollment was and whether that is an experience that you can look at to assess the expected enrollment impact in 2010, presuming you have to put through additional member increases or cut benefits then?\nJim Murray: As I mentioned to the earlier questioner, we’re in the process of going market-by-market evaluating benefit designs and premiums that we’ll likely put into place.  There is a benefit cut level that we’re trying to align around and trying to evaluate how many members we would likely have moving back into the Medicare program or perhaps to competitors.  We feel very confident that the offerings that we’ve evaluated so far are going to be competitive and they are going to provide the members with a substantial value proposition.  So, we’re not prepared right now, obviously, because we are bidding against ourselves, if you will.  We’ll know more in October when we see what some of our competitors do, but we’re cautiously optimistic that when we get done our benefit plans are going to be very, very competitive and we feel, again, cautiously optimistic that next year we’ll see some growth.\nCharles Boorady: You imposed first time premium this year and seem to hang on to a preponderance of your lives.  Do you have any data on people who might have left because of the premium you imposed versus the percent you kept?\nJim Murray: Help me understand what you are specifically looking for.\nCharles Boorady: Essentially, how do members respond when you impose a monthly premium on them.\nJim Murray: The membership, we broke it into the different premium increases and we saw a persistency issue at some level of premium increase.  We believe that there is a premium level that people begin to evaluate their choices and that’s one of the reasons that I mentioned earlier.  We are going to look at that particular premium level and evaluate what we want to do with benefit cuts and premium increases, given what we saw last year about that specific premium level where again, it looks like people look around a little bit more than other increases.\nMike McCallister: Let me add to that. There are some things we did learn relative to premiums and what we do know is that we can sell a product with a premium to seniors with our distribution capability, because there is a value proposition there that they can sell.  What we had happen, as you know, is we had people out there with zero premium products.  We sold a lot.  We had some churn because of the zero premium competitors and we don’t know what people are going to do next year, but I would find it incredible that anyone would be out there with a zero premium product in 2010.  So, we are going to be premium against premium here as opposed to the stark reality of a premium versus nothing.  I think overall we have to feel pretty good about where this is going to come out.\nRegina Nethery: We are going to need to move on.  We have a number of people in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital.\nJoshua Raskin: My first question, Mike you have talked for years, and year, and years about a targeted 5% overall Medicare margin.  Obviously things are going slightly better than that, so I am curious as you think about 2010; one of the components you are not talking about in terms of changes would be potential margin change i.e. getting back to that 5%.  I am just curious if that is in the plan as well. Then, Jim, the favorable development, obviously a big number $169 million, but it was actually down a little bit on a year-over-year basis.  Based on what was recognized last year in the first quarter I would have thought it might have been up this year.  Is there anything in the favorable developments that could spike up?\nJim Bloem: Again, we used our same conservative reserving methodology that we always use.  Again, it is based on all the actuarial information that we have.  We continue to think that people over think this, so we give them all of the information that is in the press release regarding how it works and you’ve picked up on the piece of development to date.  I would go back and say that we’ve, again, booked to a constant level of margin.  We continue that margin. So, again, we feel very good about our reserves and we look at it.  By the time we get to the end of the year, again, there has been a lot of consistency in the last couple years and I think we’ll see that again this year.\nJim Murray: To your first question the goal we have each and every year is to increase our profitability year-over-year so as we’re evaluating on a market-by-market basis we’re trying to determine what we think the competitive landscape looks like market-by-market and making decisions around a specific market level contract level plans that we have in some of those that it makes sense, perhaps to attempt to grow membership in others it looks like it’s more appropriate to maintain the higher margins and so when we put all of that together the end goal for us as a company is to make more money year-over-year as you might expect. So, it is a very, very evolving process and we feel very good about where we sit right now.\nJim Bloem: I will just add to that Josh.  I have said 5% for a long time and that is still where we work.  I mean we go into this whole process every year with the idea that for our entire Medicare book of business we think about 5% is where it ought to be.  Now there are a lot of moving parts associated with that.  We have to look at the total company, as Jim said, it is a huge variation based on location and geography and where we think we are relative to medical cost management and a lot of different things.  I think generally we are staying in that range and it has been a little higher, it has been a little lower.  Last year it was a little lower, right now it is a little higher, but we always go into it with 5% in mind.\nMike McCallister: That is important to note, we struggled to make 4% least year.\nJoshua Raskin: Right, fair enough.  I guess I was just asking, you guys have a little bit extra margin.  You have already added premiums.  You seem, relative to your competitors, probably in better shape for next year, so I was just curious if the goal was to maintain that membership or is this goal, as Jim Murray just talked about, of just increasing the profits every year?\nJim Murray: The goal is to increase profits year-over-year and as you might expect a 1% margin change up or down had some pretty significant implications on the number of members you have to gain, so we evaluate that pretty in depth and again, lots of moving parts, but again, as we sit here right now, we feel cautiously optimistic about how things are playing out so far.\nJim Bloem: The percentage margin is one thing, but the dollar margin, as Jim says, the dollars that we earn, that’s the part we’re trying to move up.  The 5% is a year-over-year long-term moving average.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew Borsch: I have a question about the potential expected fix to the physician SGR.  What do you think about the time frame in terms of when that would need to get done in order to still be able to roll through something to the 2010 rate potentially?  Is there a time frame that you think this has to get done by?\nJim Murray: We’ve provide Mike and Heidi Margulis, our Senior VP of Government Relations some dates that would make the most sense.  We would love to see something done before the CMS finalization of rates in August. If it happens later than that, we will obviously stand ready to do whatever it takes. That fix is worth $25.00 of benefits and premiums and from my point of view it saves some significant disruption in the senior population and it is something that a lot of people in Washington ought to be focusing on.  So, we will do whatever it takes to get it in time and we would ask that the folks in Washington feel the same.\nMike McCallister: We’ve put a lot of energy as we’ve gone through building out each of these benefit and premium proposals and there are thousands of them that have to go in and prepared ourselves for scenarios around what would happen if we get a late change to this so that we could quickly react. So, we are prepared.   Congress will do what it’s going to do and we can’t drive the timeline.  We’ll have to see how that plays out.  I know there is significant pressure out there to get something done about this, because it is kind of an outrageous concept that we’re going to put the seniors though all this, this next year and then turn around and reverse it by formula in the following years.  So it is kind of an awful lot of wasted energy.\nMatthew Borsch: If I could just ask on your slide presentation you showed on page 7, you showed the PPO product compared to Med Supp plan with stand alone PDP.  Is that sort of what is never going to be completely apples-to-apples, but is that pretty close?  In other words that sort of implies that the product is providing effectively about $60.00 a month in additional value, if I’m reading this correctly.  Would that be inclusive of the 4% to 5% rate cut that’s on the books for now?\nMike McCallister: Yes, the answer to all of your questions is yes.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay.  All right, I’m good for now, thank you.\nJim Murray: And remember that is the PPO.  The HMO, obviously, has significantly more value than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Lake with UBS Investment Research.\nJustin Lake: You gave us some color around the PMPM Medicare Advantage premiums that you reported.  Can you give us just a little more color on the break down?  It was up 10% year-over-year; that is a big number.  I am just curious how much of that is 1x catch up on those risk adjusters versus what we can expect to continue as the year-over-year increase in yields going forward.\nJim Bloem: Actually it is very little.  You are right that the Medicare per member per month Medicare Advantage premium is up 10%, but that is driven by a lot of factors, and the one that I mentioned that changed the guidance was a very small change.  Here are the kinds of things, and I am sure you know a lot of these, but if you think about us they particularly apply.  First of all you have the base rate that you get from CMS. Then, as we have talked about, we are one of the few companies that added a premium this year for 2009, so that increased it.  Then we did a number of acquisitions in the last three quarters of 2008 gave us a lot more members.  Then we also got a mix of business issues, again, we’ve got HMOs, Private Fee-For-Service, PPOs and then the geography of where things are changed and then finally the demographic mix, the age, the gender of our members etc.  So all of those things go into that 9.9 increase for the premium per member per month and the amount that made the guidance change, again the guidance went up $0.15 and as I said that has the investment income reduction and the commercial reduction in Small Group membership, but again it just takes a very small change in that MRA thing to produce the change we did today.\nJustin Lake: My second question, I just want to follow up on Josh’s question on the 5% target.  Mike, specifically, you went through a lot of time last year on the first quarter call going through the steps you were taking to get the 4% margin back to 5%.  When we fast-forward to 2010, are you going to be talking to us about getting 6% back to 5% and what you’ll be doing there? Then to take that a step further, if we don’t get a change in these rates, is there any possibility that Humana would be willing to accept lower than even that 5% margin target for 2010 in order to maximize their benefit designs with the expectation that rates will bounce back in 2011 and you will kind of smooth it out?\nMike McCallister: First of all, let me tell you how we think about this.  You are going to start with the entire company and we ask ourselves what can all of our product lines produce; where are our earnings, what do we think is a reasonable growth potential off of those earnings; then we start looking at all of our products, including in this case Medicare, to continue to try to find a way to continue to grow the company.  None of these things are etched in stone.  If I could find a way to significantly grow earnings on the back of a 3% margin would I do it, of course I would.   So it is all about working with a number of moving pieces.  We generally shoot at this 5% number for Medicare, because it has been fitting how it works our company for a while, and as we get further into the year we will think about that.  As we know more where we’re going to stand against competitors, as we see what we think we can do with all of these various proposals and bids, all of that is going to come together.  We intend to grow earnings next year; whether it is going to be 5% or 5.5% or 4.8%, at this point it is too early to say.\nJustin Lake: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Nersessian with Credit Suisse.\nGreg Nersessian: My question is on the commercial business.  Last quarter you pretty much brushed off the potential impact of the slowing economy on your Commercial Group membership and obviously you have changed your view on that point.  So, I was wondering what specifically did you see change, since you reported the fourth quarter numbers, that has caused you to change that view. Then if you could help us understand as to how the seasonality might change this year in your high-deductible health plan products from the impact of the slowing economy.\nJim Murray: I was the person who brushed it off, as you so aptly put it and I own that, so.  Here is what happened from the time we talked last until today.  We did a number of things.  One of the things I talked with you about last time we spoke was that we were going to increase our pricing on our, particularly our Small Group business and we did that.  That was one thing that went into the membership issue. Another thing that we did was we chose for the Small Group is made up of 2 to 25, 26 to 50, and 51 to 99 case sizes.  For the 51 to 99 we weren’t pleased with where our medical expense ratios were running and so we change our underwriting approach from an employer question approach to an employee question approach.  We tried to understand more about the particular pieces of risk in those groups that we were looking at, and that went over well in probably 60% of our markets.  In 40% of our markets the competitors didn’t follow suit and so that caused a little disruption, more so than we had anticipated. Finally, when we last talked we have a thing here called Other Group Movement, which is the net, net effect of lay-offs and individuals deciding to drop coverage.  For all of 2008 that Other Group Movement for the Small Group block was averaging around 1,500 to 2,000 members for month.  When January hit the number was closer to 6,000. We thought okay, January has a little bit higher enrollment activity than other months.  Unfortunately for us that stayed at around 5,000 to 6,000 in February and March. All of those three pieces added together caused the change in the way that I looked at our Commercial membership.  We’re obviously identifying a number of fixes to get after.  Specifically it’s a Small Group issue.  We did talk about some ASO cases that left us and that was okay, because some of what happened there was competitive situations that we weren’t willing to accept.  So, we have some things that we’re doing on the Small Groups side to get after it. Around new products, we have our new consumerism products in the second half of the year that we’re going to roll out.  When we roll out products we do market visits and we will, we call them road shows, so that we will get in front of a lot of brokers.  We are going to expand some of our value propositions.  Some of our, what we call, under writing days, where we have under writers meet face to face with brokers.  We are doing some things around bonus programs. So, we anticipate that towards the tail end of the year that the Small Group losses that I just referenced will start to mitigate, but we’ve tried to be conservative with our reductions. As it relates to the question that you asked regarding the high-deductible health plans, we saw some benefit for that in the first quarter and we’ll likely see some negative in the fourth quarter.  But overall, some of the pricing that we did, that I referenced at the beginning of my response, is driving the improvement in the medical expense ratio for the overall commercial block up 100 basis points or perhaps even a little bit  more so.  We are pleased with the way that the commercial profitability is starting to be positioned for the year, and this Small Group enrollment issue is something that, as you might expect, has my attention. So, sorry that we weren’t as on top of this as we should have been when we had our last call, but we are all over it now.\nGreg Nersessian: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen \u0026 Co.\nChristine Arnold: In regards to Medicare Advantage, could you give us a sense for the churn that you ultimately saw in the first quarter kind of gross adds, gross losses?  Then how much of that increase PMPM of, I think you said 9.9%, was going to risk adjusters that you either have received first quarter or expect to receive later in the year?   Finally, can you talk about the loss ratio?  Given the churn, how confident are you that you’re seeing the underlying trends and what kind of metrics do you look at there?\nJim Bloem: Let me start with the last two.  We are very confident that, we continue to watch weekly and daily the trends and everything, so we know that the expenses that we’re booking are the expenses that are actually being incurred. As far as how much of how much of the 9.9 is risk adjustor, again it is not a very large amount, because think about what I said before.  We introduced a member premium.  We’ve got the base rate from CMS.  We’ve got the acquisitions that we did and then everything else it really goes in terms of the lines of businesses, how we expand the network product over the Private Fee-For-Service, so not a very big number.\nMike McCallister: I have a couple of follow-ups to your questions.  On a gross basis our sales were $367,000 which includes about $114,000 of plan-to-plan changes; so net MAPD sales were around $254,000.  Our market pool agency had an absolutely incredible year and we appreciate all the good work that they do.  One of the things that I would follow up with, some of Jim’s remarks that as he said in his remarks, are the risk scores for the new members that we’ve got were very similar to the risk members that we got last year and the risk members that we got the year before that.  The improved risk scores are for our persisting members where we are getting paid the amount that we should be based upon the risk that we’re assuming.  So, this isn’t an issue about any kind of surprises in the new membership that we received. The increase here is a function of the documentation and again, being paid for the risks that we’re assuming.  And, as you might expect, lots of metrics around here at Humana.  We look at claims almost on a daily basis.  Particularly the drug claims and we are very pleased with what we are seeing not only in the PDP, but also the MAPD claims.\nChristine Arnold: Okay, my final question is on cash deployment.  Why so little repurchase with all this cash and the shares where they are?\nJim Bloem: We have adopted a philosophy for the last year now, really, since the recession began 15, 26 months ago, that we are going to prudently have a bias towards conserving cash, just because again, as we said, look at investment income, the ability to issue debt, things like that.  We’ve got a very solid financial position, as I mentioned.  Our credit facility doesn’t expire until 2011 and the first of our senior notes not until 2016.  But, we are being very cautious about the use of cash right now, even though you are right, it would be wildly accretive to do.  It is still a matter of a lot of companies that have done that, not in our sector necessarily, but everywhere that have used up their cash have sort of regretted doing it; so we would like to see further evidence of stability in the credit markets and in the cash markets, for that matter, before we continue repurchasing.\nChristine Arnold: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.\nScott Fidel: Can you give us your initial impressions on this new swine flu outbreak and do you know if any of the initial 20 cases in the US have been Humana members?  Can you give us a sense of what type of impact on this could have on the business if it continues to spread around the US?\nJim Murray: I read about the swine flu over the weekend for the very first time and we’ve got a lot of folks who are looking through to assess the issues, but frankly, it is early in the process.\nMike McCallister: I would say there is homework that gets done around subjects like this, whether it be this one or any other pandemic kind of issue out there and in fact natural disasters.   So, it is not like we have never thought about this.  We have folks who have spent a lot of time with plans and preparations for these kinds of things, but it is way to early to have any idea whether this is going to have any impact on us or any of our members.\nScott Fidel: Then a follow up on health reform and maybe now with it looking like there will be a reconciliation provision included.  I would like your thoughts around timing, will it potentially not be until Fall now, so we really have a good sense of this.  Then I would like your updated, what you are hearing just the conversation around the public plan and how that could be framed and the chance of that actually coming out including something like Medicare rates as compared to it being based more on commercial competition.\nMike McCallister: It is a little hard to say at this point.  Even though you are starting to see a little more clarity about what people are thinking the process might look like, I would say that the devil is still going to be in the details around all of this.  I will tell you that the public plan option, which is nothing but a government run health plan is a real lightening rod and could disrupt everything, so it will be interesting to see how committed some folks are to such an idea. Our industry has done a nice job of preparing for this both from the standpoint of having really positive, solid policy positions that we put forward that are really structurally different.  It is surprising to some folks up there.  We will see.  We have a good grass roots capability that will be applied when and if and where necessary.  So, I think we are prepared to argue the points and the policies as well as play the politics if it is necessary to get to the right place. But, I think there is a lot of time left here before we have anything to really work with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Rex with JP Morgan.\nJohn Rex: Just back a minute towards thinking of managing through 2010 and assuming that we don’t get any benefit from the physician fee fix and the rest.  I mean how willing are you to be the smoother for the senior as you go from 2010, 2011.  So, think of the business kind of over that two-year cycle.  And, you kept saying if we could take lower margins a long with the net earnings growth, but I guess coming back to more, would you be willing to take no earnings growth to be that smooth, as long as you could see your way to the fact that in 2011 this gets fixed and gets back into the rates?\nMike McCallister: Well what we can never count on is a long-term thing, from the standpoint of the political side of this.  That idea is clearly one that’s on the table.  We look at that sort of thing all the time and I think we owe it to ourselves to do that.  Because, we have said all along we plan on being on Medicare over the long term.  We think it is a long - term business opportunity even with some of the clouds that are out there.  So yes, we have to think about that, but I would also say that there is no guarantee that it would go the other way in 2011, because someone may step in and intervene in that formulary process. So the formula would say it comes back in 2011, but one of the real judgment calls is whether you trust it will actually happen or not.  So, these are all what we get paid to think about and try to make decisions around and I can tell you our bias going in is we anticipate growing the companies earnings every single year.  As like in 2010, we plan to do it again. So we will have to work through it. Quickly, to throw in, there are other lines of business that are a part of our ability to make money. So, those are parts of the levers that we constantly evaluate.  It isn’t just MA that we do here, as you know.\nJohn Rex: But, do you think it is completely unfeasible?  So, say you got there and you had confidence on the 2011, it’s coming back: is it completely unfeasible to think about 2010 as being a flat to modestly down earnings year?\nMike McCallister: It is way too early, I think, to talk about that.  I mean, again, the principles we operate around here is early earnings, we still have that as our bias.  We have work to do on all this Medicare bit work. We have to see what our competitors have done in October, before we will even have a good yield, no matter which way we go.  So we are always in this cherry because of the way this business, Medicare Advantage business, has been and the timing around it. You know, we put our cards on the table and we don’t know how they’re going to play until we turn them all over in October and then we have a really good view of the following year.  Generally we have done a pretty good job of being able to look at that point forward and have a pretty good view of it.  So, I don’t see anything different at this point.\nJohn Rex: Okay, but you wouldn’t dismiss it out of hand. That is a possibility at least.\nMike McCallister: Well, I mean we have an obligation to think about what’s best for the company long term and clearly that could be one of the decisions, but I’m not here to tell you that it is.  We would be irresponsible, I think, not to think past just one year.\nJohn Rex: Right sure and can you just remind us in the longer-term, again.  When you look at a Medicare member, what kind of a differential do you think you have to have longer term?  What kind of differential does a senior need to perceive in terms of value in MA versus being in the traditional plan?  Also, how much extra benefit do you think is the break point to get, especially to get new seniors to enroll in MA?  Is it 10% do you think roughly when you look at your membership and success there?\nMike McCallister: I think that is a function.  We know the seniors fall into various segments.  Some are going to be motivated by a different inflection point around that than others are, so there is no single way to think about that.  Some are more focused on benefits versus premiums.  I think it is overly simplistic to think of this as a homogenous crowd, because they are not. We put a lot of work into trying to find out where those inflection points are among the various segments to try to get the right balance between premiums and benefits to appeal to as broad a population as we possible can. Because, we think we can meet all of them at some point in some product array.   So, there is no single way to think about that.\nJohn Rex: I guess I was thinking when you think about their all end costs and traditional versus regular.  Do you assume that seniors would still enroll if you couldn’t score any kind of cost save between MA and Private Medicare?\nMike McCallister: Well if it was a perfectly flat environment we would have a less compelling of a value proposition, but we do have some things just beyond the benefits.  I mean we have the simplicity of having a single insurer with an umbrella coverage that covers everything from Part A, Part B, C and D.  All of that is valuable.  We have better information flows than a traditional line up of Medigap.  I mean if any of you had parents that are sick and you have all of these separated plans, it is a nightmare just to do the paperwork. So the value proposition goes beyond just the benefits and the premium, but those are obviously the most powerful ones.\nJohn Rex: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Carl McDonald with Oppenheimer \u0026 Co. Inc. Carl McDonald - Oppenheimer \u0026 Co. Inc. Assuming status quo on the Medicare rates for 2010, do you anticipate from an industry perspective enrollment will be flat, up, or down relative to the million plus lives that have been added the past couple of years?\nJim Murray: Based upon where everything is being discussed now, I would anticipate that there would continue to be some growth.  As we talked earlier, when you array us and our products against a traditional program and a Medigap policy to go with that, and a PDP product to go on top of that, the value proposition is there for the seniors and I think seniors are beginning to increasingly understand that.  I think the $10 million that we talked about the last time we were together in New York is now driving closer to 11 million folks who are in an MA program.  So, I continue to believe that there is value there for the seniors and it is a part of us and the rest of the competitors in the industry to share with folks. This discussion has been all about premium levels.  There are other value propositions that come with Humana and so that is one of the things that we constantly focus on is those other value propositions, rather than getting into a conversation around commoditization.\nMike McCallister: I would comment further.  I was looking at a schedule the other day that outlined the market share of Medigap versus Medicare Advantage over the last few years.  Medicare Advantage has really been capturing market share from Medigap markets.  One of the reasons we teased out this Des Moines comparison this morning, is because that is one of the primary competitors to Medicare Advantage and you can see that even with what happens in 2010 in that particular market, and even if you put all of that new issue into premium you are still way below Medigap in terms of premium. So there is a long way to run before Medicare Advantage is not competitive against the Medigap, because you have to remember Medigap keeps going up as well.\nJim Bloem: And Carl, also the ageing are very familiar with managed care type products as opposed to the old indemnity products. So, as 2.7, 2.8 members come in next year age into being 65, that also helps.\nJim Murray: One more thing, not only to address this most recent question, but also to address some of those that we got before.  Mike showed a slide, I believe, that demonstrates what we’re focusing on, on the 15% solution.  Nobody has talked or asked about that and that is a big part of how we think about this and the ability over the next couple of years to drive to that 15% solutions.  We’ve got 500 contractors through out the United States who are putting networks together that have a significant amount of savings associated with them.  We’ve been spending significantly around some of the things that are shown on that slide around disease management programs, behavioral linkages with medical nurses in particular markets.  All of those things are beginning to come together and we’re really seeing some increasing opportunities on that 15% solution.  So that has got to be a part of this whole thinking.  It isn’t just about this negative 5% decrease.  It is about what are we doing in addition to that to get after the whole value prop.\nCarl McDonald: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Costa with FTN Equity Capital Markets Corp.\nPeter Costa: Can you give us an idea of what your days claims payables is going to do going forward?  The last few years it has risen through the year.  Do you expect that to continue, if you look at your explanations for the decline this quarter, you’d think it could go up at least a couple of days.  Is that the right way to think about it, or how should I be looking at that?\nJim Bloem: Somewhere in between those two, because again, if you think about the reasons that we enumerated to give that it came down, those are all really good reasons in terms of operation. We paid claims faster, we do those things and receipt cycle time is less.  We’re working very hard to continue to put in those operational improvements that get people paid accurately and quickly.  Again, I would say somewhere in between. We still, again, are very pleased.  What we try to do is not really drive for a day figure, but just do the best we can operationally and then see where it comes out and then tell you why it is different than last time.\nPeter Costa: Okay and then back to the swine flu question.  What sort of things do you think you’re going to be doing in terms of monitoring and how fast will you know whether people are prophylactically prescribing things like Tamiflu and Relenza, an things like that?\nJim Murray: We were talking about it before the call and I’m sure I’m going to get an update from the folks who are evaluating just exactly what we’re seeing in that regard.  Until I get an opportunity to get off of this call and go and talk with those folks I really can’t update you.  But, if we see anything that is significant, we will obviously advise accordingly.\nMike McCallister: Obviously we have good visibility into prescriptions for such things as that.  We will know pretty quickly.\nPeter Costa: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Bernstein Research.\nAna Gupte: I have two specific questions related to reform. The first one is around the Medicare provider payment reform debate that is ongoing in Congress.  Also, could you elaborate on how you as a leading Medicare plan are participating, if you are, in that debate,  particularly around the advance medical homes raising, PCP pricing and the expense of specialists and do you see that changing the distribution of your HMO and PPO offering or any benefit to that 15% or long-term trend moderation solution?\nMike McCallister: I guess I would say that those are all fine ideas they’re pursuing.  I would be somewhat doubtful about the ability to execute on those in any kind of a way that would have a material impact on the marketplace.  One of the great ironies as we talk about this whole Medicare reform and changing physician payment methodologies and the pay-per-performance and this endless list of things that people talk about, it is remarkable. I am in Washington frequently.  I will stop at a meeting and I will say you know what you just described with all of this, a managed care plan.  At which point you could drop a pin, because nobody wants to think of it like that.  So, we do all of the types of things that are being suggested as some sort of a solution.  We are better organized because of the way we’re structured and the way we’re paid.  So, from a pure competitive perspective I don’t find much fear in all of this at all.  I think the execution difficulties surrounding some of these ideas are huge, given my 30 years at this. I think Humana is positioned well and I think Medicare Advantage is positioned well.  I think it is interesting.  It is probably good for the country for those people to pursue these sorts of things for the non-Medicare Advantage membership, but I don’t think it affects our business.\nAna Gupte: My second question is around the individual market.  You have a very, very strong individual and consumer franchise and if any of these universal access proposals come into play, do you see that any potential underwriting margin compression, even if there were an individual mandate?  Do you see that being offset over the long-term because the rule of brokers and broker commissions may change in a different clearinghouse type model?\nMike McCallister: That will determine how that clearinghouse model works, I believe, as much as anything else.  One proposal is that it is more of a clearinghouse for information.   Others would like it to have a lot more direct control over the marketplace.  Some would like to have the agents and brokers squeezed out of the business.  Others are not targeting that. So, again, this is one of those where depending on the details, all of what you described is quite possible I don’t know at this point whether the individual market would even be the place where that connector would have the most impact, because their decision may be to go a different way and you may end up in an effort where you are expanding Medicaid and doing other things to get people that are  uninsured into the marketplace. Again, we as an industry, as a company, have very specific proposals about how to set this up so that it works.  We will be a part of the conversation through out the summer and I think the end of the day we will have a solid point of view, because we understand the implications of these various choices.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Matt Perry with Wachovia Capital Markets.\nMatt Perry: First going back to share buy backs, it seems prudent to me that you’re kind of building capital on the balance sheet and you have said that volatility in the market is one of the reasons why you’re not buying back shares.  Can you talk a little more about how those thought processes work between management and the board?  What sign would you need to see maybe to think about buying back shares? Then how much does healthcare reform and the significant uncertainty of what might happen if a bill is passed.  How much does that inform your opinion on share buy backs?\nJim Bloem: That lateral one does, but before we get to that one, normally in the first half of the year, given where the credit markets are, which you already understand that part of the discussion.  But, then there is also the part where we show each of the states that we do business in, we have 34 operating subsidiaries, what we did last year and what our plans are for this year and what’s the appropriate amount of capital we think should be kept there. So, we have those discussions and then we also have meetings with the credit rating agencies regarding what the parent ratings are and then what the claims paying ability of the subs are. We are still in that process and generally every year in the second quarter call we begin to talk about the results of that.  That will inform, to use your term, some of what’s available.  Then we still have, again, we have talked about it all morning, about the uncertainty of health reform and the other things and the credit markets.  So, we want to continue to be prudent about it and those will be sort of the things. The first step would be let’s see how discussions go with the states.  How much is dividend able, how much needs to be retained, how much needs to be contributed.  Then look at what the rating agencies say about the claims paying ability of each of the subs and our parent ratings again, we will look overall. So what we see going forward. That is kind of how the board, the board is active, the board does act; everyone realizes that, that it would be quite accretive to do it, but again, conservation of capital right now is sort of what we’re doing.  We’ll update you next time.\nMatt Perry: Okay and then a separate question maybe for Mike.  I have another healthcare reform question.  I think there is a lot of varying opinions on what a public plan would mean to the health insurance industry.  What is your take, having spent a lot of time in DC.  Do you subscribe to the belief that any public plan, even if it is set up at first to be kind of a level playing field, would eventually morph into something that would pay Medicare rates and crowd out the private sector.  Or do you think there is a viable way to set up a public plan that just promotes competition?\nMike McCallister: I don’t think it matters much how it starts.  I think we know how it ends.  All we have to do is look at our Medicare program and we know what happens.  That has been around for 40 some years.  So, where are we today in Medicare, which is providing healthcare to people in the same way that we do, we’re financing it.  And, you have a government that does price setting with providers, therefore producing a cost shift to the private sector, which this year is in excess of $80 billion.  So, the rationale that that somehow is a competitive and effective and efficient program is just outrageous. My suggestion would be that if it starts even, and frankly I don’t know that it would, but if it starts as a level playing field, I think over time it would deteriorate to where they would go back to price setting and doing what the need to for their own budgetary reasons. So, I think we have to fashion this market so that the private sector, and our industry has proposals on the table to do this, and solve the fundamental problems that are screaming out for this supposed public need for this plan.  I think we can solve the problem so that we don’t have to have a public option under any scenario, because I think it is a slippery slope to a nationalized healthcare program. We will be a part of that conversation.  We make proposals.  We can solve this program without going down that path and the idea that it will be a level playing field, to me, is a goof.  It won’t be.\nMatt Perry: Okay thanks for that perspective.\nMike McCallister: I will just wrap it up real quick.  I think we had a really good quarter.  I am really pleased that all of our Medicare projections that we made last year for this year are playing out as predicted.  Our Medicare Advantage business is solid.   We’re benefiting from it as are the consumers, the seniors.  I think it continues to be quite solid and I think based on what we’re looking at in 2010 and beyond we have issues to deal with relative to changes. But, I think it remains a good business that we’re positive about. Lastly, I want to thank the Humana associates, who are on this call today, for making all of this possible.  With that, thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for joining today’s Humana conference call.  This concludes our conference.

In addition, today's press release has been posted to our website.  Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. First, Lonnie will present the quarter's business highlights. Gary will follow with operational highlights.  Marshall will follow with a review of our second quarter financial results. Aleks will discuss sales and marketing highlights, then I'll provide our financial forecast for 2009, and finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. With that, I'd like to introduce Lonnie Smith, our Chairman and CEO.\nLonnie M. Smith: Thank you for joining us today.  It has been an interesting 6 months.  Despite the challenging economic environment, patients, surgeons, and hospitals continue to recognize the value our products bring to surgery and surgical outcomes.  During the first six months, procedures grew by 56%, which compares well with the 50% in the first half of last year.  Revenue grew by 12% excluding the revenue deferrals and reversals that will wash out by year end.  While this is not the 60% growth we enjoyed in the first half of last year, I consider our ability to remain in positive growth territory during the worst worldwide economic downturn since the Great Depression a significant accomplishment and our team’s operational execution exceptional. Pro forma operating income year to date before revenue deferrals and non-cash stock option expense grew by 12%.  We repurchased $150 billion in stock at an average price just under $107 per share, invested $40 million in capital and intellectual property, reduced working capital by $21 million, and ended the first half with $902 million in cash and investments--equal with year end 2008 and $162 million than this time last year. As most of you know, we took a $20 million revenue deferral in the first quarter, associated with our offer to customers who purchased Da Vanci S systems in the first quarter to upgrade to the new SI system.  We recognized $14 million of that deferral in the second quarter. I excluded the impact of the revenue deferral in my summary of our first quarter financial performance and will exclude the reversal of deferred revenues in my summary of the second quarter.  With that background, operating highlights for the second quarter excluding the $14 million in deferred revenue during the quarter were as follows:  Procedures grew approximately 52% over the second quarter of 2008.  We sold 76 Da Vinci Surgical Systems, down from 85 in the second quarter of last year.  Our international team contributed 20 of the 76 systems sold.  We ended the second quarter with 1242 Da Vinci systems installed worldwide.  Total revenue was $247 million, up from 13% from last year.  Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $94 million, up 28%, and total recurring revenue grew $136 million, up 32% from prior year, comprising 55% of total revenue. We generated an operating profit of $110 million, before revenue deferral and non-cash 123R stock option expense, up 13% from the second quarter of last year.  We ended the quarter with $902 million in cash and investments, up $80 million from last quarter.  Significant cash outlays during the quarter include $13 million invested in intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment.  Excluding the impact of this outlay, $6 million in cash for stock proceeds and $7 million change in working capital, we generated $80 million in gross cash from operations, $2.07 per fully diluted share and 128% of our GAAP reported net income in the second quarter. With that, I’ll pass the time over to Gary Guthart, our President and Chief Operating Officer.\nGary S. Guthart: During our last earnings call, we announced the introduction of our new Da Vinci SI surgical system, and during Q2, we had the opportunity to showcase the SI system at several major conferences, which included the American Urology Association, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the World Robotic Gynecologic Symposium, the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgery to name a few, with an excellent customer response.  Evidence of this response can be seen in the proportion of the SI system sales within our Q2 results, achieving 62% of system sales in the quarter.  The improved vision system, enhanced user interface, and dual console capability which expands the surgical training paradigm have been well received in both academic and community medical centers.  We will continue to extend the SI product offering to other international markets during the subsequent quarters. Speaking of the new SI, Dr. Jay Michael Smith, a leading cardiac surgeon at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, remarked, “The SI dual console will bring a huge opportunity for robotic surgery in complex procedures, both in the ability to train surgeons in advanced technique and in the ability to work collaboratively during a case.  It takes the fourth arm from a static retractor to a dynamic instruments that exceeds the capability of a bedside assistant by giving them articulation and 3-D vision.”  Of the new Vision system, Dr. Tim Wilson, an experienced laparoscopic and robotic urologic surgeon at City of Hope Medical Center in Los Angeles reported, “I think this is the best image I’ve ever seen in any laparoscopic surgery.” For the systems installed to date, the SI has been used in approximately 1000 cases.  The SI’s clinical performance and dependability have exceeded our expectations.  As always, we remain committed to developing significant products that deliver clinical value to patients, are easy to use, and facilitate repeatable and teachable procedures.  We continue to invest in developing novel instruments for our Da Vinci platform and improving and expanding our imaging capabilities and developing new patient side mechanism and in creating surgical networking and training technologies.  Our development teams are focused on bringing high clinical value products to the market quickly while our manufacturing organization is relentless in the pursuit of quality, efficiency, cost reduction, and inventory management. With that, I will turn the call over to Marshall for a review of financial highlights.\nMarshall L. Mohr: As reported last quarter, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their Da Vinci S systems to Da Vinci SI systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade.  We also offered those customers the opportunity to return Da Vinci S accessories in exchange for Da Vinci SI accessories.  As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million in revenue in the first quarter comprising of $18 million of system revenue associated with the system upgrade offer and $2.1 million of accessory revenue.  These customers were given until June 30th to accept our offers. In our second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of the total $20.1 million originally deferred.  Nineteen of the 45 system upgrade offers were accepted.  $12.4 million of the $13.8 million related to 26 declined system upgrade offers and six completed system upgrades.  $1.4 million of the $13.8 million related to accessory exchange offers declined or completed.  We expect the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million associated with 13 accepted upgrade offers to be recognized by the end of 2009. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the first quarter deferral of $20.1 million and the second quarter recognition of $13.8 million.  Our second quarter revenue was $247 million, up 13%, compared with $219 million for the second quarter 2008, and up 18% compared with $208 million for the first quarter of 2009. Second quarter revenues by product category are as follows:  Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $94 million, up 28% compared with $74 million for the second quarter of 2008, and up 16% compared with $82 million in the first quarter of 2009.  The change compared with the second quarter of last year was driven by procedure growth of 52%.  The change compared with the first quarter reflects increased procedure volume and customer buying patterns. The amount of instrument and accessory we realized per procedure including initial staffing orders was approximately $1880 per procedure, down approximately $360 per procedure compared to last year and up $90 per procedure compared to the first quarter.  The decline in revenue per procedure compared to the second quarter of 2008 reflects lower stocking orders, procedure efficiency as certain customers are using less instruments per procedure, and customer buying patterns.  The increase from last quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns. Second quarter 2009 systems revenue of $114 million was $5 million lower than the $116 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2008 and $24 million higher than the $87 million of systems revenue for the first quarter.  We sold 76 systems in the second quarter of 2009, compared with 85 systems last year and 66 systems last quarter.  We continue to feel the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment in the ongoing economic recession, particularly in the US.  Fifty-six systems were sold in the US during the quarter, compared with 66 systems last year and 44 systems last quarter.  Twenty systems were sold outside of the US, compared with 19 last year and 22 last quarter.  Forty-seven of the 76 or 62% of the units in the quarter were Da Vinci SI systems. Our first quarter average sales price per system including all Da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1.43 million, and increase from the $1.33 million realized in the first quarter reflecting the 62% mix of Da Vinci SI systems of which five were sold with second consoles. Service revenue increased to $41 million, up 40% compared with $29 million last year and up 5% compared with $39 million last quarter.  The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system installed base. Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue increased to $136 million, up 32% compared with the second quarter of 2007 and up 12% compared with the first quarter of 2009.  Recurring revenue represented 55% of total second quarter revenue compared with 47% in the second quarter last year and 58% last quarter. Moving on to gross margins, there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the $20.1 million revenue deferral, and therefore, all of the $20.1 million first quarter deferral and the $13.8 million second quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income, and pretax income.  Excluding the impact of the deferral activities, gross margins were approximately equal in the first and second quarters of 2009 at about 71.5% and slightly better than the 71.2% realized in the second quarter of 2008. Second quarter 2009 operating expenses of $91 million were up 16% compared with second quarter 2008 and up 8% compared with the first quarter.  The quarter over quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 34 employees added during the quarter, higher non-cash 123R compensation, and increased R\u0026D costs.  In addition, patent amortization expense increased to $3.8 million for the quarter compared with $2.2 million during the second quarter of 2008 and $3.5 million last quarter. Second quarter 2009 operating income was $100 million or 38% of sales compared with $78 million or 36% of sales for the second quarter of 2008 and $45 million or 24% of sales for the first quarter of 2009.  Excluding the first quarter deferral and the second quarter recognition, second quarter 2009 operating income was $86 million or 35% of sales, compared with $78 million or 36% of sales for the second quarter of 2008 and $65 million or 31% of sales for the first quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense, compared with $20 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $23 million last quarter.  The increase in 123R expense primarily reflects the impact of our annual option grant made on February 17th. Our second quarter 2008 other non-operating income of $5.2 million was approximately the same as the first quarter of 2009 and approximately $500,000 less than the second quarter off 2008.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 40.4% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 40% due primarily to higher state taxes. Our net income was $62 million or $1.62 per share, compared with $51 million or $1.28 per share for the second quarter of 2008 and $28 million or $0.72 per share for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter deferral and the second quarter recognition, our net income was $54 million or $1.40 per share compared with $51 million or $1.28 per share for the second quarter of 2008 and $40 million or $1.02 per share last quarter. Now moving to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $902 million, up $80 million from March 31, 2009, and approximately the same as December 31, 2008.  The increase in the current quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $7 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $13 million of capital expenditures.  Since December 31st cash flow from operations of $173 million and stock option exercises of $12 million net of capital expenditures of $40 million were entirely offset by $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $175 million at June 30th, from $139 million at March 31st.  The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue.  Our net inventory decreased to $59 million at June 30th from $64 million at March 31st.  Our inventory declined during the second quarter primarily due to the utilization of material built up to support the Da Vinci product launch. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.\nAleks Cukic: During the second quarter, we sold 76 da Vinci systems, 56 in the United States, 12 in Europe, and 8 into rest of world markets.  A total of 5 systems were part of trade-in transactions.  The net 71 additions to the installed base brings to 1242 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 916 in the United States, 221 in Europe, and 105 in rest of world markets.  Sixteen of the 76 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a fifth system to Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati and third system to Florida Hospital in Celebration, Florida, and Florida Hospital in Orlando, Florida, and Strong Memorial in Rochester, NY.  This brings to 152 the total number of customers who own two or more da Vinci systems.  Internationally, we placed 4 da Vinci systems into Germany, 3 into the UK, and 2 into both France and Qatar. Clinically, we had an excellent quarter.  For the third quarter in a row, we had double digit sequential procedure growth, both domestic and internationally.  Demand for da Vinci hysterectomy, both for benign and malignant conditions, sacral colpopexy, myomectomy, partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and da Vinci prostatectomy were most notable.  We also experienced early international demand for a number of our general surgery procedures, specifically Da Vinci colon and rectal procedures and Da Vinci thyroidectomy, most of which is emanating from Asia. In Q2, well over 200 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts were published within peer reviewed journals, and as Gary mentioned, our participation within various medical conferences corresponding with the Da Vinci SI launch was very strong. Over the past several quarters, the management of endometrial and cervical cancer has been one of our largest and fastest growing areas of focus.  The clinical value of converting these predominantly open high invasive operations to a minimally invasive da Vinci procedure has become widely accepted.  The surgeons at Northwestern University Medical Center in Chicago reported the impact this shift was having on fellowship training at their university.  Dr. Anna Hogstra and team authored a paper entitled, “Robotic Surgery in GYN Oncology: The Impact on Fellowship Training” which was published in the May edition of the Journal of Gynecologic Oncology.  Prior to the adoption of da Vinci hysterectomy for both endometrial and cervical cancer, Northwestern’s fellows predominantly participated in open surgery which represented 94.4% of their surgical oncologic training.  This percentage corresponded with the level of open cancer surgery within their practice, but three months post da Vinci implementation, the fellows participated in robotic procedures was up to 45%.  After six months, 72%; and after 12 months, it was up to 92%.  The author summary was as follows, and I quote, “Fellows surgical training underwent a dramatic change with the introduction of robotic surgery program.  The management of endometrial and cervical cancer was impacted the most by robotics.  Robotic surgery broadened fellowship surgical training, but balanced surgical training and standardized fellow training modules remain challenges for fellowship programs.” The transition from open surgical oncologic management toward Da Vinci is not limited to US borders.  In the May edition of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, Dr. Magioni and Piretti from the European Institute of Oncology, a teaching hospital in Milan, Italy, published a paper which outlined their significant shift toward the robotic approach to endometrial and cervical cancer surgery.  The authors reviewed patient data from 80 consecutive da Vinci hysterectomies for endometrial carcinoma.  Data collected included BMI, operating time, histology, blood loss, conversions and postop pain management.  Rather than run through all the numbers and statistics associated with their findings, I’ll sum it up with their conclusion which I believe says enough, and I quote, “Over a relatively short time using the Da Vinci surgical system, we observed a substantial change in our surgical activity.  For endometrial cancer, open surgical procedures decreased fro 78% to 35%.  Moreover, our preliminary data confirmed that surgical robotic staging for early stage endometrial cancer is feasible and safe.  Age, obesity, and previous surgery do not seem to be contraindications.” The incorporation of Da Vinci into residency and fellowship training programs has become increasingly popular, which we believe represents a meaningful and potentially powerful shift in the training pathway of future attending surgeons, in both the US and abroad. We’ve not commented much on our cardiac business during the past few calls, but we did see a nice increase in both Da Vinci mitral valve repair and Da Vinci revascularization procedures during the quarter.  We’ve always believed that patients evaluate their surgical treatment options using an equation that balances efficacy and invasiveness.  There is perhaps no clear example of a more favorable score than that associated with a Da Vinci cardiac procedure.  Even though the growth of cardiac category has not mirrored urology or gynecology, the relief from postoperative pain and suffering probably exceeds them both. In the April edition of the journal Cardiology, Dr. Bonatti and team from Innsbruck Medical University in Innsbruck, Austria, and the University of Maryland in Baltimore set out to evaluate postsurgical quality of life at 3, 6, and 12 months, comparing open revascularization to da Vinci revascularization.  The study included 120 patients split pretty evenly between open sternotomy and Da Vinci’s endoscopic approach.  Nine patients were converted from an endoscopic approach to a sternotomy which were also assessed postoperatively.  The comprehensive analysis evaluated several factors, including but not limited to hospitalization, operating time, postsurgical pain and discomfort, time to resuming normal activities such as taking shower, gardening, riding a bicycle, driving a car, and shopping.  The result of the comparisons was pretty dramatic. Hospitalization for the da Vinci patients was approximately half as long when compared to the open patients.  The time to take a shower was reduced from 9.8 days for an open approach to 3.7 days for the da Vinci approach.  Gardening was reduced from 54.2 days to 22.2 days, driving a car from 35.5 days to 16.4 days, walking outdoors from 15.5 days to 6.2 days, and riding a bicycle was shortened from 67.2 days to 28.2 days.  I think you get the picture.  Virtually all quality of life metrics improve significantly incorporating the da Vinci approach.  In their conclusion, the authors remarked, and I quote, “TCAB using robotic technology leads to improved physical health, shorter hospital stay, and more rapid restoration of daily activity.  Conversion from TCAD to sternotomy does not lead to a quality of life impairment as compared with primary sternotomy.” Regarding our urology business, we continue to see a tremendous adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, and da Vinci cystectomy taking place on a worldwide basis.  The agenda at this year’s AUA Conference held in Chicago was a Da Vinci testimonial in and of itself.  Presentations, clinical abstracts, live surgeries, postgraduate robotic courses, and booth presentations dominated this year’s conference.  The mass global appeal of da Vinci-based procedures within the specialty of urology is truly material.  During the 4-day conference, we registered over 1000 urologists at our booth, representing nearly 40 countries.  The most popular area of inquiry remained DVP; however, Da Vinci partial nephrectomy, cystectomy, and pyeloplasty are all procedures that are being rapidly adopted. Among the more interesting abstracts at this year’s AUA pertained to prostate cancer mortality rates following radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation, and primary androgen deprivation therapy.  A large multicenter series was derived from the CAPTURE Registry which accrues patients from 31 practice sites prospectively and follows then under a uniform protocol regardless of treatment and follows them through death or withdrawal from the study.  8321 men with localized disease at the time of the diagnosis with at least 6 months followup after radical prostatectomy, EBRT, or PADT were analyzed.  The study was authored by Dr. Matthew Cooperberg and the Urologic Oncology Group from the University of California at San Francisco.  The study used CAPRA scoring which is cancer of the prostate risk assessment which is a well-validated instrument incorporating PSA, Gleason score, age, percentage of biopsy cores positive, and caner stage.  A parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes among different treatments adjusting for CAPRA score and age. It was a very comprehensive and statistically relevant approach toward assessment the various treatment methods.  The results: 261 men died of prostate cancer at a median 6.4 years followup.  Adjusting for age and risk, the hazard ratio for cancer specific mortality was twice as high for an external beam radiation therapy than for radical prostatectomy and 2.3 times as high for primary androgen deprivation therapy versus radical prostatectomy.  The author’s conclusion, and I quote, “Surgery for localized prostate cancer is associated with a significant and substantial reduction in cancer-specific mortality relative to EBRT and PADT.  Although not a randomized study, the analysis was adjusted for clinical risk and age, and it is unlikely that the unmeasured cofounders would account for the large observed difference in survival.” Our strong belief has always been that the removal of the cancerous prostate through surgery is the most effective treatment for patients with localized prostate cancer, especially so when taking into account long-term survival.  As patients are diagnosed earlier in life and better informed on their treatment options, we would expect our DVT opportunity to further expand. This concludes my summary, and I now will turn the time over to Ben.\nBenjamin Gong: I’ll be providing an update on our forecast for 2009 based on our results in Q2.  First and foremost, procedure growth which is the primary driver of our total revenues continues to be strong.  Procedures grew approximately 52% in the second quarter.  In our last earning call, we forecasted procedures to grow more than 40% for the year.  We are increasing our forecast on procedures to grow more than 45% for the year.  This will continue to drive significant growth in our instrument and accessory revenues; however, as we have mentioned previously, variations in initial stocking orders and customer ordering patterns can cause our instrument and accessory revenues to fluctuate and difficult to forecast on a quarterly basis.  Therefore, we will not be reinstating guidance for instrument and accessory revenues at this time. Likewise, while strong procedure growth continues to drive high demand for system sales, the general slowdown in hospital capital spending makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast how many systems we will be selling in the near term.  Therefore, we also will not be reinstating guidance on system revenues at this time. Our service revenue model has been very consistent, and we expect it to remain as it has in the past.  We’re generating an average of about $148,000 in service revenue per system per year.  Since our revenue is driven largely by the installed base, we continue to expect service revenue to grow approximately 35% this year. With regard to gross margin, excluding the one-impact of the $20 million revenue deferral in Q1 and the release of a portion of that deferral in Q2, our gross margins have been very consistent with that of previous quarters.  Since the balance of Q1 revenue deferral will be recognized the end of the year, the deferral should have no net impact on gross margin in 2009.  In our last earnings call, we forecasted our gross margin for the year to come in between 70% and 71%.  Based on our gross margins to date, we estimate that gross margin for the year will be approximately 71%. With regard to operating expense, last quarter we provided a forecast of growing our GAAP operating expense by approximately 17% in 2009.  We are increasing our estimate to 18% to 20% growth in operating expense based on two factors.  First, we estimate our stock compensation charge for the year to be approximately $98 million compared with our previous estimate of $95 million.  Secondly, we’re hiring more field personnel to drive continued procedure growth, and we’re increasing our investments in new and existing R\u0026D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. With regard to income tax, we continue to expect to report a GAAP tax rate of approximately 40% for the balance of the year.  For calculating earnings per share, we ended the quarter with approximately 37.9 million shares outstanding, and approximately 700,000 shares were added to the diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q2.   For the balance of the year, assuming we do not repurchase any additional stock, we expect our share count for calculating EPS to be between 38.6 million and 39 million shares.  Finally, regarding our cash flows, we continue to generate significantly more cash than our reported net income.  For the first six months of 2009, we generated $173 million in cash flow from operations, compared with our reported net income of $90 million over the same periods.  The largest contributor of this difference was our recording of approximately $47 million of FAS123R stock compensation expense year to date, and we expect to record an additional $51 million in stock compensation expense in the second half of this year.  As a result, our cash flow should continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. That concludes our prepared remarks.  Before we open the call to questions, we ask that you limit your inquiry to a couple of questions, and for any followup questions, please get back onto the queue.  We will now open the call to your questions.\nOperator: (Operator instructions)  The first question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank\nTao Levy: On the gross margin side, you’ve given the number of SI that you sold and also your procedure growth.  I would have thought maybe you would have seen some sequential improvement, excluding the deferrals, instead of just staying at 71.5%.  Is there any scrap material related to the S or anything going on there?\nBenjamin Gong: No, really there is not.  Even though you have a higher ASP due to the higher price of the SI, the cost of producing an SI system is actually higher than it is for the S, and that’s why the gross margin was very similar even though you have a mix of SIs in the sales mix.\nTao Levy: Aleks, you talked about the paper on prostate caner and long-term survival, have you looked at an analysis on the cost difference between the different therapies, and a question that kind of ties into that maybe for Lonnie because I’m sure he’s got a perspective on it, any thoughts on what’s going on with healthcare reform, the thoughts of comparative effectiveness, maybe having robotics a part of that?\nLonnie M. Smith: Clearly, we have.  It’s interesting to me.  Proton beam reimburses about $72,000 if you assume 40 treatments which is about the average, and IMRT reimburses, and these are CMS reimbursements, just under $40,000.  Brachytherapy around $29,000; and surgery assuming comorbidities and complications is about $10,000.  All of those include both the facility fees as well as the surgeon or the physician, and Aleks pointed out those numbers.  Actually, there was a longitudinal study of a little over 3000 patients at Henry Ford and found that life expectancy over what you call conservative treatment which will be hormonal treatment or watchful waiting was 4.6 more years of life, and this is age adjusted, disease stage adjusted for radiation therapy, and 8.6 more years of life for surgery.  Now, if you do a simple calculation, I’m a simple minded guy, I divide the cost by the number of years of additional expected life, and for proton beam, assuming it’s the same as other radiation therapies is about $16,000 per year of additional year of life, about $9000 for IMRT, about $6000 for seeds, and less than $1000 for surgery.  So, in terms of comparative effectiveness and things like that, we’re big proponents of it, especially if it’s a level playing field, and people go into without a preset agenda.  So we have some interesting days ahead, but I really do think that comparative effectiveness can lead us to a better place with healthcare both in terms of cost and outcomes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew – William Blair.\nBen Andrew: You talked about, I think, a relatively high percentage of de novo systems coming in this quarter in particular.  Can you speak a little bit more about what you were hearing from customers and what you think was driving that mix shift?\nMarshall L. Mohr: It’s hard to say in a single answer that drove each of them, but what would like to say is if you think about the customers that do not have a da Vinci system and the pressures that they face, for example, radical prostatectomy has moved to what is widely accepted now as standard of care through Da Vinci, if you are not participating in that, you have that impact on your radical prostatectomy program.  If you look at the hysterectomy consolidation that is going on both for benign and malignant conditions, if you again have not participated in a robotics program, you have missed that and potentially will miss quite a few going forward, so if you put yourself in a position of a customer that has a system, your participating in it, and now you’re looking at your capacity and what you can do with that system or that second system or third system.  If you do not have a system, you’re viewing it a little bit differently, and so I believe that customers are looking at that a little bit closer with really some pain that they are feeling on lost procedures.\nBen Andrew: Aleks, did you see anything relative to not as many people adding capacity or are they just working harder to take advantage of the capacity out of the existing system before buying a new one or was there something unusual there?\nAleks Cukic: I can’t answer that, but perhaps Jerry can give you some color on that.\nJerome McNamara: Over the last three quarters as we have gone into this change in the economic environment, we’ve seen customers try to extend the available slots per surgery per day, so they are really looking at their efficiencies and maximizing the number of surgeries before they buy a second system, so we have seen a shift in the buying pattern.\nBen Andrew: As you look at the international rollout opportunity for the SI, what percentage of your available market if you will has access to that product and when would you get to broader rollout?\nGary S. Guthart: I guess the areas that we don’t have regulatory approval right now include Asian countries like Korea, China, and of course Japan where we don’t have any approval for any type of system, and then in other parts of the world, Canada, we are still waiting for approval there, and registration in some parts of South America.  By and large, we have Europe pretty well covered, and we did sell SI systems in Europe this quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Just thinking about revenue per procedure, I know you are not giving obviously a significant new guidance; obviously the procedure numbers were up, but your reversal in revenue per procedure was interesting.  Does this indicate signal to that the relative level of destocking pressures have ceded or that the relative mix between hysterectomy and prostatectomy has ceded, so should we expect flat revenue per procedure going forward?\nMarshall Mohr: You are right.  We are not providing guidance.  The amount of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure is going to vary from quarter to quarter based on the number of stocking orders or new system sales and stocking orders associated with it, and customer buying patterns will also have a big influence over it, and we are not ready to predict what those customer buying patterns are going to be for the next few quarters.\nDavid Lewis: Marshall, was there a reason that this quarter would have seen a reversal in that trend, and why that may not be repeatable in a forward quarter?\nMarshall Mohr: We believe we have seen in the first quarter particularly and at the end of even Q4 we saw hospitals managing their inventories and their costs very closely, and so we believe they managed them down more so in the first quarter.  It’s just not possible for us to predict how much more they need to manage them or will manage them going forward.\nDavid Lewis: In terms of new system placements, the de novo placements in the US market place, can you give us a sense of those?  It sounds like 40 new system placements or new version placements.  What was the average size of the hospital in terms beds that those systems were placed into?\nMarshall Mohr: I don’t know that we have that breakout at this stage.  Perhaps later we can give you that information, but I don’t have that available.  I can say that we sold to large academic medical centers, and I’m aware of even small hospitals.  In fact, even some fairly small hospitals that purchased dual console systems, so I don’t think there is anything remarkable about this quarter versus historical past in terms of size of hospitals.\nJerry McNamara: I don’t know that there is a differentiation on the size of the hospital and a correlation between that and the de novo system purchases.  If you want some steps, there are three steps that people typically want.  The large hospitals, there are 457 sites with 614 systems.  The medium-sized hospitals, 176 sites with 190 systems, and the small hospitals, 100 sites with 112 systems, totaling 733 sites in the US with 916 systems.\nDavid Lewis: You are obviously expanding R\u0026D it sounds like here in the back half of the year, but if you think about a series of deals the company did, some externally and some internally as it relates to attacking single port procedures or better visualization, when can we start seeing some of the significant product launches associated with what seem to a pretty substantial internal focus on this area starting middle of last year?\nGary Guthart: As we’ve said before, we don’t announce timelines for them before they are ready to be launched.  In general, our investments are really focused on long term, so a lot of these things are all looking out into the future, both in IP acquisitions and in technology developments that will give us growth into the future.\nDavid Lewis: Let me ask you just one different way.  One of your quasi-competitors in the instrument space is thinking of rolling out better articulating instruments in the back half of 2010.  Do you think the marketplace as you see it is ready for single port procedures and articulating instruments in back half of 2010?\nGary Guthart: I think we’ve seen in the marketplace already several companies who are looking at single port and articulation.  We think that the robotics will have a role to play in single port surgery, so we’ll have to see how they rollout, and we’ll see how we enter the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.\nUnidentified Analyst: I’m curious to hear how you guys view the mix of the SI versus the standard model systems going forward.  Obviously, you have pretty impressive performance for the SI in the first quarter post launch.  I’m just wondering does this have to do with teaching institutions purchasing more systems early on, or would you expect this kind of a mix to continue based on the benefits of the system?\nBen Gong: Historically we have seen that a lot of customers like to have the most capable system that we offer, and that happened when launched da Vinci S in 2006, and we see it happening again with the launch of da Vinci SI, so we think the majority of the systems that we sell going forward will probably be da Vinci SI, although we are continuing to sell da Vinci S systems.\nUnidentified Analyst: In terms of upgrades of your current installed base, did you see any upgrades in the quarter?  Can you help us handicap that opportunity?\nBen Gong: Yes.  We made those offers to those Q1 customers which as Marshall mentioned 19 of those 45 offers were taken, and we were capable of installing 6 of those in the quarter, and we will install the other 13 in the latter part.  Think of that as a concentrated number of upgrades.  Other than that, we’ll probably see some upgrades from the existing customer base that purchased prior to Q1, but it’s probably not going to be a large number each quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Obviously, you’re increasing investments in R\u0026D and in clinical investments again.  I’m just curious as to your thoughts about the environment.  Do you feel a little bit more comfortable with the environment in terms of hospital capital spending and economic environment at this point that are you’re taking these actions or has anything changed?  Obviously, you’re not updating guidance.  Has anything changed in your mind now as of the end of the second quarter versus where you stood in the first quarter of ’09 when you withdrew the guidance?\nLonnie M. Smith: We don’t manage the business or our R\u0026D on a quarter to quarter basis.  We really believe that robotics will play a significant role in healthcare and surgery for decades, and we are investing with that kind of mindset, so we aren’t going to pull back because this quarter might be a little bit weaker or something else.  We’re investing for the long term.  We have been building this business from the beginning that way.  We’ll continue to do so.  We have high confidence in the long term, and that’s where we are investing for.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sameer Harish with Needham \u0026 Company.\nSameer Harish: Did I hear correctly that you sold 5 second consoles in the quarter?\nMarshall Mohr: That’s correct.\nSameer Harish: Do you have an idea or can you talk a little about what you are expecting as far as salesforce expansion in numbers?\nJerry McNamara: We don’t provide the specifics on that.  We did add 20 people to the field organization this past quarter, and that was on top of 25 people that we added in the first quarter, and that continues to comprise a large portion of the total headcount we add.  That 20 in Q2 was out of a total of 34 people in the company, so we definitely are continuing to hire in the field.\nSameer Harish: If we look at that international versus US, what do you think is the level of investment that you feel will be necessary for international growth in 2009?\nJerry McNamara: Part of the people that we are hiring are for the direct business in Europe, and we are again continuing to look at various ways of expanding through our distribution channels as well, so we’re investing not just through hiring in our direct business but hopefully investing with our distribution partners as well.\nSameer Harish: I guess if you look at it as a change from what your expectations were last quarter, is most of that increase directed towards international or is it split pretty evenly?\nLonnie M. Smith: It’s consistent with the metrics that by which we measure the business in the past, so we add clinical heads as per a number of systems that are placed, so we’re sticking to the same metrics that we managed the business last year, the same metrics this year.\nSameer Harish: Just to switch over to R\u0026D.  Again, as we look at it incremental versus last quarter, are you looking to invest more on product development or clinical work to expand indications?\nGary S. Guthart: We really invest in all of those things.  We invest in clinical side, we invest in research and in development as well as some IP acquisitions, so you see it in all those buckets.  There is not a radical change in which buckets these things go into.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.\nTycho Peterson: On the utilization of the SI, is there any change in mix?  In other words, are you seeing adoption per procedures beyond what you saw with the traditional S system, and can you also comment on whether you’re seeing any interest, I know it’s early, for the dual console outside the teaching hospitals?\nMarshall Mohr: As far as the first question, I don’t think there is enough data at this stage for us to make any or really expect that there is going to be much of a difference in terms of the uptake.  I think there are a lot of variables that go into the success and the early success of a program depending on the commitment from the hospital and other factors.  The system is certainly designed to improve ease of use and some of factors, but it’s early for us to say that it’s had a material impact on the rate of adoption yet.  As far as your second question on the dual console, there were hospitals that were outside of the, call it, traditional larger academic medical centers that did purchase second systems.  I should say they purchased dual console systems, and again these took place during the quarter, and we will be able to comment on it more as they become more familiar with a quarter’s worth of usage in the future, but there is definitely interest both within academic medical centers as well as outside within community-based, non-academic medical centers.\nJerry McNamara: But again, it’s really too early for us to give you a call on what percentage our sales are going to include dual consoles.\nTycho Peterson: Just a followup on the prostate market; obviously with the New England Journal article this spring, there’s been some noise that the number of prostatectomies could be impacted with potential declines in PSA testing overall as well.  Can you just comment on whether that’s something that you’re picking up on still or are you still expecting the prostate market to grow significantly in the near term?\nLonnie M. Smith: It’s interesting.  During the quarter, there was an AUA gathering of 15,000 urologists from around the world, and I can say that as long as I have been associated with this business, this debate has been going on, and certainly even longer than that, and I think it will continue for sometime in the future.  There were some really spirited discussions on it.  In our view as we look at it, we don’t look at it as something that is going to materially impact our business one direction or the other at this point.\nGary S. Guthart: The European portion of that study showed that there was improved survival rate, significant survival rate, with PSA testing, and the other part of the study was inconsistent in terms of the consistency of the testing, so at least for me, I’ll be tested.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vincent Ricci with Wells Fargo Securities.\nVincent Ricci: Aleks, you guys mentioned increased adoption in general surgery, particularly lower anterior rectal surgery in Asia, and I’m just curious, has some of your ability to increase adoption there been around any kind of instrumentation you been working on?  You called out some instrumentation that seems to be linked to that.\nAleks Cukic: No.  There isn’t anything that the Asian community is getting that is not available in the US market or anywhere else for that matter, and you might be referring to something like a surgical stapler which we talked about developing.  There is nothing that’s driving it there.  I would say that the growth in the Asian businesses is certainly large, but there is also solid growth in the US business in colorectal surgery.  Thyroidectomy on the other hand is largely driven out of Asia, but in terms of the colon and rectal surgery, sort of equal set of instruments globally and good growth going on globally, more so outside of the United States and Asia.\nVincent Ricci: Is there any specific dynamic that makes thyroidectomy a good procedure in Asia or is that just more of a cultural thing?\nAleks Cukic: It’s something that they are certainly more sensitive about.  They are more sensitive about the scaring that goes on with the operation in a traditional operation which is an incision in the neck, and again it is early for us to really draw a lot of conclusions other than the fact that it is growing very rapidly, and it is growing very rapidly in the Asian countries.\nVincent Ricci: Marshall, there has been a lot of talk about tax reform.  You guys clearly don’t have a lot of the problems that some companies that might be impacted would have, but you guys have also been talking about longer term tax planning initiatives.  Can you just walk us through what we should be thinking about not only in the near term but also 2-3 years out?\nMarshall Mohr: A caveat in that is I don’t think the administration is done in their attempts to modify the tax code, so I can only speak to what we have seen so far, and based on what we have seen so far, our previous plans that were laid out are still okay, I guess, is the way to put it, and that means that sometime probably next year you’ll start to see some improvement in our tax rate, and we’re hopeful that we can get it down to like the mid 30s over time.\nVincent Ricci: You guys have largely been on a run rate in the mid-teens for repeat placements, and I’m just curious, is there is a certain dynamic that helps drive that consistency there?\nGary S. Guthart: The dynamic that drives the second system placement is really hospital adoption in running out of capacity with their first, second, or third or whatever it might be.  I don’t think there is anything that sort of stops it from being more in the mid teens or less than, so I think that’s probably coincidental.\nLonnie M. Smith: That was our last question.  As I have said previously while we focus on the financial metrics such as revenues, profit, and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma.  I hope the following patients’ personal stories in their own words give you some sense of what that means in the lives of our patients.  The first is Christie’s story.  She says, “On December 15, 2008, I got the devastating news I had cancer.  In a whirlwind, I was referred to an oncologist who determined I needed surgery which I had on January 22, 2009.  At 2 p.m., my gynecologic oncologist and I had decided to use the da Vinci surgical system because we felt it was the safest and the most likely to provide satisfactory results.  I went to sleep, and when I woke up my worst postoperative issue was nausea from the anesthesia.  Around 8:30 a.m., my doctor happily discharged with simple but important instructions.  Days 1 through 3 postop were spent mostly in bed, except fro a few important walks.  By day 7, I no longer was taking even the mild pain pills I was prescribed, and on day 9, with my doctor’s permission, I was back on my treadmill, starting slowly of course.  My surgery was an amazing success on several fronts, first because my surgeon had the freedom of movement and visibility, he was able to be sure that he removed all the cancer.  I went from having stage 1b grade 3 endometrial cancer to no evidence of disease.  By mid February, I formed a cancer advocacy research company.  We provide research grants to medical students in our area.  I speak to about 2000 people each month, less than 4 months after surgery, about cancer prevention, screening awareness, and about the da Vinci robotic system.  It not only saved my life; it saved my quality of life.” The second is Beth’s story.  “I am 30 years old.  I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse at the age of 14.  I went through my teenage years and a portion of my adult life before it needed to be repaired.  When I began seeing my current cardiologist, Dr. Michael Bach, years ago, he made me aware that surgery would more than likely be in my future.  My regurgitation was moderate to severe.  I was as much prepared as I could be.  My husband and I were married in October 2008, and the news came less than 2 months after our nuptials.  The timing was difficult, but I kept my eye on the picture.  My health was most important.  We also want children, and my condition at the time would not have allowed it.  Dr. Bach referred me to Dr. Douglas Murphy, and I’m forever grateful that he did.  The procedure amazed me, and the overall experience was a positive one.  There is pain and discomfort with any surgery, but overall it could have been much worse had it not been for the miracle hands of Dr. Murphy and the da Vinci surgery.  Three and a half weeks later, I’m already feeling better than ever.  My scarring is minimal, which was something that was important to me personally.  I can’t say enough about this procedure and the experience I had.  I feel so blessed in so many ways.” Patients like these are the strongest advocates for surgery with the Da Vinci system and are the foundation of our operating performance. In closing, I assure you that we remain committed to focusing on the vital few things that truly make a difference as we strive to take beyond the limits of the human hand.  That concludes today’s call.  We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey.  We look forward to talking to you again.

Welcome to Seagate Technology's fiscal second quarter 2009 preliminary financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call contains forward-looking statements including but not limited to statements related to the company's future financial performance. These forward-looking statements, including any references to the savings we may achieve under our recently announced cost reduction plan as well as impact of the impairment charges we may take with regard to our goodwill and other long-lived assets, are based upon information available to Seagate as of the date of this conference call, but are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 13, 2008 and in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2008. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company's views as of any subsequent date and Seagate undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Steve Luczo, CEO. Please go ahead.\nStephen J. Luczo: Thank you, [Wesley]. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Pat O'Malley, our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Whitmore, who heads R\u0026D and manufacturing operations, Brian Dexheimer, head of our Consumer Solutions Division, and Kurt Richards, head of our Global Sales. Before we get to results of the second quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the announcements we've made over the past couple of weeks, as well as to discuss the challenges posed by the current business environment. I'll then give you my perspective on our business going forward before turning the call over to Bob and Pat. We are currently experiencing one of the most dramatic economic downturns of our generation. Macroeconomic trends are worse than what anyone expected even just a few months ago. While we continue to firmly believe that Seagate has a solid future and we view the long-term prospects for storage to be positive, there are significant short-term challenges facing Seagate. Companies of all types, regardless of size or industry, are being negatively impacted by this global downturn, and most of these businesses, large and small, are significant consumers of storage and therefore of Seagate's products. Due to the ever-changing and declining economic environment, the Board determined that now is the appropriate time to make changes in the leadership team, to facilitate quicker changes in organizational structure and to implement other actions to regain our position as the leading provider of storage devices across all markets. The entire Board and the management team have the highest regard for Bill Watkins and for his many contributions to Seagate. Bill's advice and his efforts to ensure a smooth transition are much appreciated and will help us in this acceleration of change. We also announced last week that Dave Wickersham has resigned from the company as President and COO. Bob Whitmore has assumed the additional operational responsibilities previously performed by Dave. Bob has been with Seagate for 22 years and is an important member of our leadership team. In his expanded role he is now responsible for all research and development and global disc storage operations. I am pleased that Bob will assume these additional duties in his role going forward. I will now briefly review the restructuring program that was announced last week. In fiscal 2006 Seagate began an expansion program to meet rising customer demand. In recent months, however, the market has contracted sharply, and when combined with some market share loss, revenues have declined significantly. In order to adapt our business model to the new economic conditions, we have implemented a series of necessary changes. In early fiscal 2008, Seagate commenced a restructuring program that to date includes the closure of our recording media facilities in Milpitas, California and Limavady, Northern Ireland, and the announcement of the closure of our research facility in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Recent actions also include a reduction in our global work force, company wide salary reductions, and other cost reduction actions that we believe will result in annual savings in excess of $300 million. These actions are part of a comprehensive plan to align the company's cost structure with the current economic reality. Pat will be addressing this in more detail later in the call. We continue to remain focused on building liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet by taking actions to reduce capital spending, lower operating expenses, and to align production with demand to control inventory at appropriate levels. Today we also announced that the Board voted to reduce the quarterly dividend to $0.03 per share effective immediately. Reducing the dividend is expected to save approximately $175 million of cash over the next 12 months. Let me spend a few minutes talking about my perspective on our business. We understand that the issues we are facing today are not solely the result of macroeconomic pressures. I believe we have the right resources in place, but that we haven't executed at the level that we are capable of. After demonstrating sustained areal density leadership through a number of product generations, we decided to manage areal density growth in an attempt to optimize our product portfolio and R\u0026D investment. This decision resulted in products that were less competitive in some markets, as overhead technologies advanced at rates greater than our estimates. Our technology assets, investments and capabilities remain intact, but we have not been efficient in deploying those technologies through the last two product cycles. In addition, our internal execution issues were compounded by the macroeconomic environment, which we believe will continue to be challenging through calendar 2009 and potentially into the first half of calendar 2010. Moving forward we need to optimize our leadership systems for faster decision-making and we need to increase the competitiveness and value of our product portfolio by better capitalizing on our core technologies. We will continue to adjust production to a level in line with our current estimates of the total available market. We will continue to structure our business to focus on building liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet so that we are competitive throughout a period that may reflect extended macroeconomic decline. To the extent that business conditions are more favorable than what we currently anticipate, we can scale reasonably to address growth. We believe a positive change in the economy will be gradual and that we have the right relationships with those customers that are positioned to see an economic upturn earliest. We believe that Seagate has a solid future. We need to make smarter and faster decisions and execute better and we will. We are committed to implementing actions that will result in Seagate being the clear leader in storage devices across all markets, providing our customers with the industry's leading technology, highest performance and highest quality products, and using our scale and technology to be the most advanced and lowest-cost manufacturer in the industry. Seagate has achieved and sustained this level of performance before and we believe we can attain it again as we re-focus on advancing areal density and accelerating deployment of our technology into our manufacturing base. Efforts along this line have started to produce positive results. Six months ago we began addressing the issues associated with our product and technology portfolio as well as the company's structure. We've built positive momentum in recent months, providing us with significant opportunities moving forward. Bob will address these improvements in more detail in a few minutes. The current environment certainly presents challenges, but as historically demonstrated, the fundamental core strengths that Seagate possesses when fully leveraged result in the company's leadership in technology, products, cost and financial performance. We are confident in our ability to execute at these leadership levels as we continue our efforts for improvement. I'll now turn the call over to Bob, who will highlight some of our product initiatives, technology and operations.\nRobert Whitmore: Thanks, Steve. Before I provide you with an update on our products, technology and operations, I'd like to give you a brief background of my career and my perspective on the company's technology and operational priorities as we move forward. I started my career with Seagate over 20 years ago as an engineer within the Enterprise side of the business. Most recently I've been focused on product development, but through the years I've led nearly every R\u0026D organization and many of the operational teams throughout the company, including management positions at our operations in Asia. I also know from my overall experience at Seagate that our greatest asset is our people, and I have a clear understanding of their capabilities and dedication. Having engaged with the global operations team, I believe we continue to be well positioned with advanced, low-cost manufacturing technologies, and I'm excited about the opportunity to lead this part of the business. I'll now provide an update of our products and technology, followed by an outlook of our capital spending. We have not been satisfied with the consistency of our product and technology execution. We recognized this several quarters ago and have been addressing it directly. Today I'm encouraged to say that we're making measurable progress to that end. Specific to areal density leadership, our accelerated plans to deliver the industry's highest capacity per platter drives are starting to show tangible results. Last month we successfully launched the industry's first 7200 rpm 500 gigabyte per platter 3.5 inch product. Both desktop and CE versions are now released and being qualified. Additionally, our 5400 rpm 250 gigabyte per platter 2.5 inch drives have been shipping in volume for over a quarter and match the leading capacities in the industry today. We have also launched our 7200 rpm model at 250 gigabytes per platter. Finally, in the Enterprise market we have now completed the refresh of our 2.5 inch product line, doubling capacity to 300 gigabytes. All major OEM qualifications are now complete. Overall, we are making progress with our new product introductions; however, simply being at par with our competitors is not our goal. Our goal is to be the clear leader in areal density and product performance, and with these recent successes, we feel we are making progress across the entire portfolio. The product advancements we have made over the last six months are allowing us to recapture qualification positions with some of our key OEMs. This is a significant step in recovering our product leadership and growing market share. In the Enterprise market we remain the leader, and I'm encouraged with our current road map and position. This road map includes the commitment to solid state devices. We are set to deliver our first SSD product into Enterprise applications later this calendar year. SSDs and solid state technology are essential to our long-term product roadmaps, and we will maintain our investment levels to deliver leading technology as required by our current and future customers. Now I'd like to address our capital spend for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. Capital investments for December quarter were $214 million. Looking forward, for the balance of this fiscal year our level of capital spending will be greatly reduced as we have completed most of our head wafer conversion from 6 inch to the most cost effective 8 inch format. We continue to minimize our capital spending in line with the reduction we see in demand and the installed capacity we currently have in place. Capital investment going forward will be targeted primarily at technology transitions. We expect capital investment for fiscal year 2009 to be approximately $650 million, a reduction of approximately $350 million from the outlook at the beginning of this fiscal year and $100 million reduced from the capital outlook we provided last quarter. Based on our perspective of the macroeconomic trends, we believe our capital investments for fiscal year 2010 will be below $500 million. In summary, clear and sustained time to market, product leadership, superior quality, and world class manufacturing are the key areas of focus for my organization. Seagate's foundation is solid, and I am fully confident in the talent and capability of our employees. Our goal is deliver sustained leadership by leveraging our technology and manufacturing capabilities across all markets. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Pat O'Malley.\nPatrick O'Malley: Thanks, Bob. You'll find the company's press release, 8-K, and additional financial information related to Seagate's financial performance and other supplemental information in the Investor Relations sections of Seagate's website at Seagate.com. First let me provide some insight into how the industry's demand and pricing environment evolved during the quarter. The December quarter proved to be very challenging with industry demand degrading throughout the quarter. When the December quarter began, the total available market or TAM for hard drives was thought to be near 156 million units. Then at about 8 weeks into the quarter, the TAM was expected to be in the 135 million unit range. And now preliminary industry data indicates actual shipments for December quarter were somewhere around 123 million units. With this type of demand and supply imbalance, pricing was very competitive, especially in the 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch ATA markets, where we believe the industry experienced a second consecutive quarter of double-digit like-for-like price declines. Now I'd like to discuss Seagate's preliminary financial results for the December quarter. These financial results are preliminary as the company has concluded that it is required to record a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the company's goodwill and possibly other long-lived assets, which include purchased intangibles and property, equipment, and leasehold improvements. The financial statements that will be included in the Form 10-Q that will be filed by the company for its fiscal second quarter of 2009 will differ from those issued today so as to reflect the outcome of this impairment analysis and any related tax impact. Seagate reported a net loss and a net loss per share for the December quarter of $496 million and $1.02 per share, respectively. Included in these results are the following items: $18 million of purchased intangibles amortization and other charges associated with acquisitions; $94 million of restructuring related charges, and A $271 million charge to reduce the valuation allowance related to the company's deferred tax assets. The impact of these cash and non-cash items total approximately $383 million and approximately $0.79 per share. Note that the adjustment to the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets will not impact our cash taxes paid going forward. For the December quarter, Seagate reported revenue of $2.3 billion, at the low end of our revised guidance, reflecting the project execution issues which we have previously mentioned, the continued softening in demand, and inventory drawdown throughout the PC supply chain and the more competitive pricing environment for the 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch ATA markets. Seagate unit shipments for the quarter were 36.7 million, down 23% compared to the prior quarter. In the December quarter we believe we lost approximately 2 points of market share. The factors that contributed to this are the continued transition of demand from 3.5 inch ATA to 2.5 inch ATA, where Seagate has meaningfully less market share, we chose not to participate in specific portions of the 3.5 inch market, and within the 2.5 inch ATA market, while our time to market 250 gig per platter product offerings continue to gain share and customers, the older product platform ceded share as our customers cut demand from the last supplier qualified, which was Seagate, before impacting those who were more timely to market. Gross margins for the December quarter compressed in excess of 300 basis points, which reflected a more competitive pricing environment, lower unit demand leading to low levels of fixed cost absorption as we reduced build schedules significantly, and a higher cost structure on older products as Seagate continues to transition to newer, more cost-efficient product platforms. R\u0026D and SG\u0026A totaled $377 million for the December quarter and included costs related to the acquisitions of $2 million and accelerated depreciation of $14 million related to our closing of the Pittsburgh research center. In addition to tight spending controls, similar to last quarter, R\u0026D and SG\u0026A was lower than planned due to the accounting treatment of the company's employee funded deferred compensation plan. As the plan's liabilities decreased again this quarter, a reduction was recorded in operating expenses while a corresponding increase was recorded in other income and expense. The net impact is essentially neutral to the P\u0026L. Let me recap some information relating to the restructuring and cost saving actions disclosed by the company last week. First, the work force reduction totaled approximately 3,000 headcount and is expected to save $130 million annually. We will see the majority of this benefit in the June quarter. The expected restructuring charge for this action is approximately $90 million and is mostly for cash-based severance costs. Secondly, a salary reduction was enacted for nearly all professional employees on a sliding scale that is expected to save an additional $80 million annually. A portion of these savings will be reflected in our March quarter results. In addition to these actions, we recently completed the shutdown of the finish media operations in Milpitas and the aluminum substrate operations in Limavady, Northern Ireland. We are well into the plan that is expected to improve the efficiency of our research effort by moving much of the activity into existing product and component design centers, enabling Seagate to exit the Pittsburgh research facility. These restructuring actions I just mentioned are expected to eliminate in excess of $300 million of spending from the overall cost structure. Additional cost savings outside the scope of these restructuring activities have been identified and have been enacted by the management team and are expected to significantly lower the cost structure of the company. Specifically, for product development and selling, general and administrative based on the actions implemented to date, our quarterly run rate spending level is expected to be approximately $340 million when full savings are realized in the June quarter. While the savings to date are significant, the management team will continue to evaluate and determine what further actions are necessary to properly align the company's cost structure with the current business environment. Now I will discuss the balance sheet, cash, cash flow and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $156 million from the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company borrowed $350 million under the existing revolving credit facility. The Board's authorization of the reduction to our dividend mentioned earlier will improve our liquidity position. Going forward, the management team will continue to monitor the company's liquidity position and determine how to best prioritize the use of cash so as to position the company for long-term success. Cash flow from operations was $89 million for the quarter while free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was negative $125 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter was $228 million, including approximately $16 million of purchased intangibles amortization and $16 million for accelerated depreciation related to fixed assets at facilities we previously announced were closing. Investments in capital for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 totaled $494 million. The current expectation for fiscal 2009 capital investments has been reduced to approximately $650 million. Looking forward, Seagate's capital investments will primarily be targeted at advancing technology and, as such, can likely be supported with an annual run rate of an amount less than $500 million. Cash conversion metrics are as follows - days sales outstanding was 42, days payable outstanding was 64, and days inventory outstanding was 37, for a cash conversion cycle of 15 days, which was 10 days longer than the prior quarter. Our target for the cash conversion cycle is 12 to 15 days. Since we are at the high end of the target range, we expect no further incremental cash to be tied up on the balance sheet in the future due to working capital requirements. Inventory decreased in aggregate by $113 million as a $152 million decrease in work in progress and raw materials more than offset a $39 million increase in finished goods. Distribution channel inventory for Seagate 3.5 inch ATA product trended down the entire quarter and ended under 4 weeks. We believe all channels, including OEM and retail, brought down inventories during the December quarter. We expect the March quarter will be much more sensitive to true end demand as inventory buffer has been reduced significantly. Long and short-term debt totaled $2.4 billion, yielding a net debt position of roughly $1 billion. Long-term debt maturities in the near term primarily consist of $300 million due in October of 2009 and $135 million due in April of 2010. The revolving credit facility has a six-month maturity with the company's option to extend the borrowing as long as covenant compliance is maintained through the maturity date in 2011. In regards to the company's liquidity position, management has recently taken many actions focused on building liquidity and strengthening its balance sheet. We continue to be in compliance with the covenants related to our revolving credit facility, and based on the current business outlook, we believe the company will generate or obtain sufficient sources of liquidity to support the business. The covenant calculations have been added to our supplemental package and can be found on Page 10. Now let me cover the business outlook. For the March quarter, in light of the company's view of the current market environment and the uncertainty in global economic conditions, for planning purposes the company's expects the overall demand for disc drives to be approximately 110 million units and the pricing environment to be similar in nature to the past six months. In addition, the company is assuming no significant changes in its market share and therefore expects revenue to be approximately $1.6 to $2 billion. Gross margins for the March quarter are expected to come under further pressure due to the competitive pricing environment and the cost inefficiencies due to lower volumes and higher component costs. Product development and SG\u0026A are expected to be approximately $395 million in the March quarter, essentially flat compared to the December quarter, when adjusted for the favorable impact from the employee deferred compensation plan. While current uncertainty and global economic conditions make it particularly difficult to predict product demand, the company expects TAM in the June quarter to be flat to slightly down quarter-over-quarter. Seagate has the potential to experience modest market share gains in the June quarter as our new products qualify and ramp in volume. In addition to a better cost structure on these new products as well as the full quarter benefit of the restructuring and salary reductions recently undertaken, the company expects to realize margin improvement in the June quarter. That concludes my remarks for today. Steve?\nStephen J. Luczo: Thanks, Pat. And before going to Q\u0026A I want to emphasize that in this challenging near-term environment, we will stay focused on what we can control - product leadership, cost and inventory management, and technology leadership. As always, my greatest confidence is in our employee base. Before we go to Q\u0026A, I'd like to indicate that Pat, Kurt, Brian and Bob will likely answer most questions that reference our fiscal Q2 results due to my recent appointment as CEO, and with respect to the future direction of the company, our comments will be reflective of the entire management team. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Kugele - Needham \u0026 Company.\nRichard Kugele: First, just tactically in terms of the quarter, can you talk about what you've actually seen from a pricing perspective quarter to date? You talked about some of the OEM aspects of it being similar, but there's been some indications of some stabilization in the channel due to the low inventory levels. Can you corroborate any of that?\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes, Rich, let me just give you a high level remark just so we make sure that people got the message. What we're planning for against this economic environment is a pricing scenario that is not that different from what we've experienced. Now, as you know, over the last several quarters, this has been the steepest and longest period of pricing decline that the industry has seen maybe ever and certainly in a long, long time, and basic economics would say that that can't sustain itself forever. But for planning purposes, we need to be prepared. To your comments about what's recently happened, there is some indications in some marketplaces that the pricing has slowed. For competitive reasons we don't want to go into the details which markets exactly, but it's actually been in several different markets and covers both OEM as well as other channels.\nRichard Kugele: And then I guess secondly from a total cost perspective, when you're looking at the future things you can do, I know you have a couple of facilities in China, you have a number of different R\u0026D facilities, do you see it being more facility oriented or do you think that there's also some streamlining even within just your headcount that can occur.\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes, I think, you know, again, it's partly based on what the business model that we drive to and what's the revenue model that we drive to. And in this demand environment and in this macro environment, it's tough to pick a number to say how do you want to structure your business for the long term versus the fact that the next 24 months could potentially be quite difficult and I think most people would agree that the next 12 are certainly not going to be fun. So those are the levers that we have to play with that you identified, you know, what we do with our structural infrastructure. The factories are actually for the most part running quite efficiently. Is there opportunities potentially? But for sure I think with respect to some of the organizational issues, as you're probably aware, the org structure changed to a business unit structure. We're now shifting it back to a functional structure, and we do believe there's opportunities in terms of both management layers, ability to delegate and restructure, that there are some opportunities certainly to pursue there. And longer term structural issues, as you mentioned, whether or not it's any facility, design related or factory related, have to be assessed in terms of the overall outlook.\nRichard Kugele: Okay, I guess, Steve, one last question. If you were to compare Seagate's issues today, the market issues, compared to 1998 and the issues you were facing then, any thoughts on how you would approach it or how you were able to solve it then versus today?\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes, I think the basic issues - or at least the manifestation of the issues - are very similar in terms of technology leadership that was lagging, execution issues, and high cost. I think those elements are the same. I think some of the things that have been driving those issues are similar and some of them are different. I think the good news today is one, there's a team in place for the most part that was actually the team that turned around the company the last time. As you probably recall, we had, I think, 111,000 employees when I was made CEO last time and I think it was 17 factories, 7 design centers, and over the course of four years we aligned the company to the business opportunity that we had and, more importantly, really invested in the technology and our heads and our discs and also integrated our design centers to a platform strategy where we could actually leverage all of our components and also therefore leverage our manufacturing assets in terms of final drive assembly. I think the good news is all that work is still here functioning and it's actually functioning quite well. As we mentioned, we did get behind in head technology. Last time we didn't have luxury to get behind because we were so far behind IBM, we just went pedal to the metal for as long as we could, and my assumption still is that if IBM hadn't shifted away from being a hardware company to a software company, we might not have ever caught them. But once they did that, we flew past them like they were standing still. With the areal density leadership that we had, we basically then in some ways had the luxury to say how do we deploy that areal density and how do we manage that growth, and the company pursued what I believe is a sound strategy of pursuing many more markets that were evolving for storage, whether or not it was consumer related or smaller devices or whatever, and in doing so we basically managed the areal density growth instead of just driving it as absolutely hard as necessary. Throw in there the fact that the 80 gig platform stayed in the market for basically two product cycles, which was the first time since 1995 that a product cycle had been less than a year, and the product planning basically missed a generation as a result of that because, again, of course, the product cycles picked back up again. Those issues are all pretty much the same. I think shifting the organization back to functional organization is obviously something we didn't have to face then, but I think there's opportunities related to that in terms of the decision-making that we'll have. The culture of the employees is as good as ever, so that strength is similar. I'm 10 years older. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'm definitely 10 years old. And of course the macro environment is completely different, and I think the challenge that we have in front of us isn't really so much can Seagate do this, because we can do it and we know how to do it. What we really have to prepare for the company, though, is for the uncertain macroeconomic environment. If we had clear view on a steady state environment, I would say the risks were much less than they were in 1997. But in an environment that really it's hard to pick that point of what's the right revenue level, what's the right pricing level, what's the right margin level - and that being driven by external factors that, frankly, no one in the world is having a decent assessment of right now - certainly makes it a more complex challenge for all of us. We're up for the task. We're going to basically move forward in a way that we believe is conservative in those assumptions, but preparing the company in the event that the turnaround happens that we can obviously take advantage of any upside reasonably. We've given you our indication of what the TAM looks like for us going forward. We don't think that as you go to industry sources that there's going to be a wide variation of that. And again, then it gets back down to pricing, you know, how long do people continue to price or does the industry price itself into an unprofitable territory and obviously basic economics limit that at some point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Min Park - Goldman Sachs.\nMin Park: First, Seagate and Western Dig have both made public comments and have started to cut back on capacity. Have you seen any signs or other indications from your other competitors that they're willing to or are planning to take capacity out of the system.\nStephen J. Luczo: That's a great question. I don't know that we could say we have anything [inaudible] public confirmation, but I think everybody's appearing to be responsible with all the macroeconomic things we're dealing with at the time.\nPatrick O'Malley: I think the other things that you're getting is obviously it's, as you said, public comments from WD. I think we're approaching it reasonable to say what is the TAM? It clearly has contracted. We're trying to align our business model to support that, which we think, as Steve said, we can take that down and reasonably take it up. But with just the press coming out of Japan with potential consolidations and all the needs to get efficiencies, there's no doubt that they're looking at - when we look at some of the shared equipment suppliers, where they're cutting back, I think it's a whole supply chain just pulling back to align with this new reality of our customers may be willing to hold less inventory and of a smaller TAM for the time being. So I think it's not unreasonable to think that everyone's doing that right now.\nMin Park: And then just jumping right into the supply chain, if you look at a number of the vendors in the supply chain, including component and capital equipment vendors, already seem pretty stressed in the current cycle. Are you concerned about the viability of your suppliers and what plans do you have in place to protect Seagate from that risk?\nRobert Whitmore: We are concerned and obviously we're watching it very closely and very carefully. We're talking to our suppliers every day and making sure that we're working with them. And I think it really comes down to a supplier-to-supplier case-by-case basis. We don't divulge any specific information on specific suppliers, but suffice it to say it's a big concern and we're working with them daily.\nStephen J. Luczo: And just to follow up on that, you know there is no supplier issue that we are concerned about currently and for most if not all of our technologies we have more than one source of supply.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nSherri Scribner: I just wanted to dig into the cash levels a little bit. I was a little bit surprised to see that you drew down on the revolver $350 million. Was there a particular reason that you did that? I know at the time you had mentioned some cash costs related to restructuring, but it seems like those cash costs are somewhere around maybe $100 million and not really the $350 million, so I wanted to understand that a little bit better.\nPatrick O'Malley: As we've talked about, the $90 million was what I'd say was a first pass. We continue to look at the levels of our cost structure. There may be more, to fund those. But that work is undergoing, so we want to have enough in there to give us leeway to fund the restructuring. As we talked about, the $90 million, that $130 million pays off annually, but it does pay off annually, so if we have any of these other activities, many of them we'll have to have the cash upfront and they'll take a stream of anywhere from six months to a year to get back, so we want to draw that in front of us so we can be very aggressive if need be, if the market conditions continue to deteriorate.\nSherri Scribner: I guess some of the questions I've had from investors have been you've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet. Is that cash accessible or is it in places that potentially you don't want to get at it for tax reasons or whatever and maybe that would be why you wanted to take the cash out of your revolver instead of using cash on the balance sheet? Just trying to get a better understanding of where your cash is sitting right now.\nStephen J. Luczo: No, all of our cash is totally accessible.\nSherri Scribner: And then in terms of the $15 million that's sort of - you don't have it this quarter, but you're seeing it again next quarter for the employee benefit stuff that's in the OPEX number, Pat, I'm just curious why would we necessarily have that $15 million in the number next quarter? I'm just trying to understand that charge a little bit and trying to figure out on a go forward basis -\nPatrick O'Malley: Okay, let me help you on that, Sherri. We took a - it was closer to $20 million credit into our comp charge. We're saying we're not going to get that benefit next quarter, so it's not a charge. It's just I'm not going to get that favorable benefit this quarter. So that $377, if you took the favorable benefit of the employee deferred comp plan, I'd have been closer to $400 million. So I'm basically telegraphing you $395 for next quarter, so essentially flat.\nSherri Scribner: Okay. And then we go into June, I think you said with the longer-term plan and the restructuring actions you've taken, that comes down to $340?\nPatrick O'Malley: That's correct.\nSherri Scribner: And so that includes those changes and so we wouldn't expect to see another number in there or a different change?\nPatrick O'Malley: Given current course, there would be no changes. If there was other activities that we enacted, you may have some effect to that, but $340 would be our steady state after the restructuring activity, reduction of all the other salary actions we talked about. So that would be what we expect to see, and if the employee deferred comp had some change, it'd be reflected in there. But $340 would be a plan steady state.\nSherri Scribner: And then just finally in terms of the restructuring, you've said $300 million in savings. How much savings should we expect to see in the COGS number taken out of your fixed costs? You've been pretty clear about what's happening in OPEX, but what should we expect in COGS?\nPatrick O'Malley: We haven't been explicit because there's many moving parts to that. Its billed material reductions, external sourcing, whether it's internal or external, so there's a lot of moving parts. We haven't been very explicit. We manage the margin through what we'd call our portfolio mix. That's the biggest lever as opposed to cost reductions out of lineups like that. There are dollars there, but our biggest lever in our gross margin is our product, competitiveness and the pricing elements. So we haven't been as prescriptive there.\nSherri Scribner: Okay, because that's a little harder to predict?\nPatrick O'Malley: Yes, and it's just not the biggest lever we have in that bucket.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Lanier - AIG.\nMike Lanier: I had a question about cash and I apologize - I got pulled away - if you've already answered this, and that is is it right that you said in the past you need about $500 million just to run the business. Is that a good number to use?\nStephen J. Luczo: $500 million is the covenant requirement, so you arguably run at less than that. I'm not sure I'd like to run at less than that given where we are even today. I always like to have a little more potentially. But $500 million is a hard covenant requirement we have, so we cannot run the business under that.\nMike Lanier: And then along those lines, because recently from the school of hard knocks we realize that just because you have $500 or $1 billion in cash doesn't mean you actually have full access to it. Can you talk a little bit about how your $1.3 billion, I guess, whatever you ended the quarter with here, how much is tied up? How much is stuck in Europe or in places where you really don't have the ability to draw upon it if you wanted to.\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes. No, Mike, we answered that. That must have been when you were off. But yes, no, we have full access to the cash that we have on the balance sheet. None of it is in places that we can't get it immediately.\nMike Lanier: And then as far as the maturities coming around, is it your plan to rebuild the cash and keep it up above $1 billion or are you just going to - you'd be comfortable if it comes down to $700 or whatever it might be. God knows, it takes a crystal ball to know how operations will go, but you do have, what $450 over the next year coming around. Is it your intention to do a capital raising to get it back up if there's no cash build from operations?\nStephen J. Luczo: Right. We're looking at the alternatives right now in terms of what's the best options for the company to manage either the retirement of that debt or the replacement of that debt. And so that's basically the task at hand right now and hope to have more information on that in the nottoodistant future. But, you know, we're looking at all the options right now in terms of how to best position the company, again, for our planning scenario of sustained macro trend that we're in today and sustained pricing trend, even though that may not be viable for the entire industry, at least planning for those. And then if things get better, great, but that's what we're [inaudible] right now.\nMike Lanier: And lastly the reduction in CapEx, I guess the way we should look at it is it's probably not going to be a competitive disadvantage because the competitors will probably be doing the same thing?\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes. At least on a preliminary basis, one of our competitors has already announced a significant reduction in capital. I think for us we're not reducing any capital that relates to any technology transitions that we have ongoing, and in fact one of the reasons the capital was as high as it was this year is because we were completing a significant technology transition. So we're maintaining capital levels certainly to be competitive in terms of technology and obviously [break in audio] capability in terms of infrastructure. And we believe that given today's demand environment, which we've scoped at 110 million units, plus or minus, for the next couple of quarters and then probably, you know, slow growth if any for the next two quarters after that, we certainly can maintain our ability to respond to the marketplace with those levels of capital.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets.\nAmit Daryanani: I think in the past you provided sort of industry TAMs across your product categories. Is that something you won't be providing going forward or could you give us that information this time around?\nRobert Whitmore: We have provided it in the past, but we haven't provided it this time because the overall market has taken such a significant contraction. These are our assessments. So we'd be probably better advised this quarter to let the whole thing shake out. We're planning our business accordingly with our customers, but there's still some variation of that 110, where that may settle. So as that gets clearer, I think we'd be better - provide you guidance at that time. But right now there's a lot of variability in the TAM from moving from market to market, so we'd probably stay away from that this quarter.\nAmit Daryanani: And then I guess if I just look at the restructuring initiatives and you've talked about OPEX going from $395 million next quarter to about $340 million in June, does that reflect 100% the savings from all the researching efforts or will there be some incremental savings beyond that as well?\nRobert Whitmore: They would be very de minimis. Most of the actions that we've talked about in that $300 million of actions are all primarily reflected. There will be some folks that'll still be around in the June quarter, but it would be very small, so you would not probably get much incremental upside to the actions we've talked about.\nAmit Daryanani: Since I've been thinking about [$300] million savings, two-thirds on the OPEX line, about a third on the COGS line is a reasonable way to model this thing?\nStephen J. Luczo: Well, I think if you did the math that comes close. That comes close. But you could probably look at it from a Q4 run rate and model down to where you see and you could probably figure out where that is. Now realize the $300 million we talk about are these restructuring activities. There's other cost reduction activities the company's undergone, so when you go through and you look at a Q4 run rate to an - '08 for a Q4 '09, you may see higher numbers, but the $300 million there is the restructuring activities we've done, so they're not the only cost reductions that this company has undergone over the last six months.\nAmit Daryanani: And just, I guess, finally, [inaudible] this $1.6 to $2 billion revenue band for the next several quarters, and I think the last [inaudible] you were in that revenue band around fiscal '09, the OPEX was around $230, $240 million kind of run rate. Is it fair to say the researching effort we may take beyond this would be focused to drive that OPEX down from $340 to the mid-$200 range?\nPatrick O'Malley: We'll look at that. As Steve said, this is a situation where we have to line up what we thing our long term is. One of the things we are committed to is to protect our technology and the key products that we think are the financial engines of the company over the next three years, so that's where we'll be protected. We also have some investment in our solid states, you know, technology that we look at that's probably above and beyond what you've seen in the past. So we'll model to deliver the technology and the products across the whole storage market over that, so we'll model accordingly and we'll come back to you, but given the high flux, the high contraction over the last six months, we'll owe you a model on that, but we're committed to get back to profitability in this company.\nStephen J. Luczo: And maybe one more question.\nOperator: Your first question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] - Bank of Montreal.\nUnidentified Analyst: I had a question on the competitive landscape with the potential combination of Toshiba and Fujitsu. Can you talk about what the impact would be for the industry and for Seagate, particularly your business segments?\nStephen J. Luczo: Yes, I think, you know, it'd be hard for us to speculate. I'm not even sure that anything official has been released with respect to it other than speculation. So I think it'd just probably be a little bit misleading to project anything other than putting two companies together is always challenging in the short term and whether or not it's beneficial in the long term depends on how good a job you did. So I think we just have to wait until we hear more from what those two companies want to talk about.\nStephen J. Luczo: Okay, everybody, thanks very much for participating today, and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes this evening's conference call. You may now disconnect.

(Operator Instructions) For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead.\nRob Eldridge: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2009 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. The following discussion or responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 22, 2009, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. As you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this web cast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Thanks Rob. I will begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12-month free cash flow grew 98% to $1.92 billion. Return on invested capital was 50% up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends. The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 451 million shares compared with 458 million. Worldwide revenue grew 28% to $5.45 billion or 29% excluding the $41 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We are grateful for our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, best selection and free shipping offers including Amazon Prime. Media revenue increased to $2.93 billion, up 17% or 18% excluding FX. EGM revenue increased to $2.36 billion up 44% or 45% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 43% of worldwide sales up from 38%. Worldwide unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 98 million, up 17%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.8 million, up 24%. Seller units were 31% of total units. Worldwide gross profit was $1.27 billion, up 27%. Now I will discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G\u0026A combined were $923 million or 17% of sales, down 107 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $444 million or 8.2% of revenue compared with 8.9%. Tech and content was $267 million or 4.9% of revenue compared with 5.3%. Marketing was $144 million or 2.6% of revenue, up from 2.5% in the prior year. Now I will talk about our segment results and consistent with the prior periods we do not allocate the segments, our stock based compensation or other operating expense income net line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to $2.84 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to $1.41 billion. EGM revenue grew 36% to $1.29 billion, representing 45% of North America revenues, up from 41%. This week we started shipping Kindle with U.S. and International wireless and lowered its price to $259 from $279. This newest Kindle is available to ship to customers living outside the U.S. Customers in more than 100 countries around the world and U.S. customers traveling abroad can take advantage of Kindle’s 3G wireless technology and download a title in 60 seconds or less. North America gross profit grew 28% to $752 million and gross margin increased 101 basis points to 26.5%, driven by increases in other revenue in 3P product sales, improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix. North America segment operating income increased 77% to $156 million, a 5.5% operating margin. In the international segment, revenue grew 33% to $2.61 billion. Revenue growth was 35%, adjusting for the $39 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact during the quarter. Media revenue grew 22% to $1.52 billion and EGM revenue grew 54% to $1.06 billion or 58% excluding FX.  EGM now represents 41% of international revenues, up from 35%. International gross profit grew 26% to $521 million, or grew 30% excluding FX, while gross margin decreased 108 basis points to 20%, driven by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix, partially offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor prices and increases in 3P product sales. International segment operating income increased 36% to $194 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, international segment operating income increased 44%. Consolidated segment operating income grew 52% to $350 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 101 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact from FX, CSOI grew 56%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses. GAAP operating income grew 62% to $251 million, or 4.6% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $60 million in Q3, or a 23% rate for the quarter.  GAAP net income was $199 million, or $0.45 per diluted share compared with $118 million and $0.27 per diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1.68 billion year-over-year to $4 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consists of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA rated money market funds and other investment grade securities.  Such amounts are recorded at fair value. Inventory increased 23% to $1.62 billion and inventory turns decreased to $12.1 from $12.4 a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 50% to $3.35 billion and accounts payable days increased to 72 from 63 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $355 million from a year ago to $1.09 billion. Our Q3 capital expenditures were $103 million. I’ll conclude my portion of today’s call with guidance.  Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe to date to be appropriately conservative assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including the high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending.  It’s not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances and foreign currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our guidance. Our guidance excludes the impact of Zappos, including approximately $35 million of expenses related primarily to employee compensation costs, amortization of intangibles and merger related expenses that would be recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 if the transaction closes as planned. Guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that FX rates remain approximately where they’ve been recently. For Q4, we expect net sales of between $8.125 billion and $9.125 billion, or growth between 21% and 36%.  This guidance anticipates approximately 500 basis points of positive impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between $300 million and $425 million or grow between 10% and 56%.  This includes approximately $100 million of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses, to be between $400 million and $525 million or growth between 11% and 46%. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. With that, Rob, let's move to questions.\nRob Eldridge: Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q\u0026A portion of the call. Operator, will you remind our listeners how to initiate a question?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Mitchell at Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell: Thank you very much for taking my question. It looks like you enjoyed very strong sequential North America revenue growth, both media and EGM, much stronger in fact than you have enjoyed in previous quarters. Could you talk about what drove that quarter-on-quarter growth in North America revenue?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. If you take a look at -- if you recall from 90 days ago, we did see a nice sequential increase, but as a reminder, Q2, we had a strong -- a difficult compare from the previous year, Q2 of 2008. But even we still saw acceleration if you look at Q1 of 2009 or Q4 of 2008. And it was very broad, you know, within the media categories. In fact, all the major categories within media saw an acceleration from Q2 to Q3, so it's very broad and it was driven by a lot of the fundamentals. You know, having great low prices, certainly we had selection increases, in-stock increases during the quarter, as well as Prime is certainly having an impact. So all of those things certainly had an impact. Also as a reminder, you know North America as we finished Q3 of last year, certainly the last few weeks of the quarter were softer, given what was going on economically. But again, we saw very strong growth in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. My question is on the margin outlook for the fourth quarter. We have heard some competitors out there are getting more aggressive with price, on books especially but other areas. Maybe if you could characterize your view on the margin environment in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, on unearned revenue, it looked like it was up $197 million, a little less growth than in second quarter or in absolute dollars. Is that reflective at all of the Kindle, or are there other things in the unearned revenue line we should think about? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of your first question, you know, what we anticipate will happen, Q4 was reflective of the guidance that we gave you. It's obviously a challenging, in any Q4, to give guidance and given what's going on externally, from a macro environment standpoint, it's certainly a challenging time to do so. But we still feel -- that being said, we feel very good about what we saw in Q3; customers responding very positively, and right now we're heads down focused on making sure that we have a great customer experience during Q4. Around the world right now we're focused on making sure that we have great low prices, that we are getting our inventory, making sure that our in-stocks are where they need to be and selection on hand. You can see our inventory did increase as we -- as it has in previous Q3s and that's really getting ready for Q4. So we're optimistic and we've given a wide range, given that optimism, and we're focused on customers. So again, hard to predict what will happen. But in terms of competitive environment, certainly it is very competitive. It's been very competitive since the day we launched and we have many different competitors in all the different categories that we operate in around the world.\nJustin Post: And then on unearned revenue?\nThomas J. Szkutak: Certainly there are a number of things that go into unearned revenue and certainly we have some marketing relationships. Kindle goes in there, Prime goes in there. So there are a number things going in. It can be a little bit lumpy, because of some of the things that go in, but certainly the principle pieces being, that we have certainly have talked about in the past being Kindle and Prime, are doing very well and we’re very, very pleased with the growth that we’re seeing in both of those and we’re excited with the announcement that we have related to Kindle that we can offer our newest Kindle at $259 effective today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from Jefferies \u0026 Co.\nYoussef Squali: Would you consider opening up Kindle to supporting other formats, considering the increasing availability of content from other providers? And related to that, is there a threshold above which you’d start actually breaking out Kindle sales for us to gauge the level of your success?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of breaking out Kindle, certainly as you get to certain sizes, we’ve done in the past, we’ve broken out various countries and we would follow whatever is required to do so, and obviously in the results that we give we try to be as helpful as we can. In terms of opening up Kindle, there’s not a lot I can add to that. I wouldn’t want to speculate what we might or might not do there, but what we are focused on Kindle is obviously to make sure we offer customer experience and we’re heads down focused on making sure that we do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital.\nDouglas Anmuth: Can you talk about your profitability and the margins in particular being about 60 points above the high end of your range? I’m just curious on what the biggest delta was on your results versus what you were expecting for the quarter there. And then secondly, it looks like your accounts payables days went to 72, which is a pretty significant increase. What were the key drivers in that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of the margin, what you really are seeing, a number of factors but certainly a principal one is you’re seeing we had very strong growth. You’re seeing very good leverage in our operating costs and if you look at our gross margin, we’re essentially flat year over year and you saw good leverage in operating costs, and really across all the key items. So we had very good leverage. Certainly when you look at our operating costs, there is a variable component and there’s also a fixed component and so the fixed is where you’re seeing the largest leverage. In terms of AP, we did see a very big increase. That’s also reflected in the inventory that we brought in at the end of Q3, getting ready for the holidays. Keep in mind that when you compare that to last year at this time, there’s a little bit of some seasonality, if you will, because if you recall particularly in the U.S. we saw a little bit of a slow down near the end of Q3. And so when that happens and there was certainly uncertainty related to what was going on in Q4, you’re seeing probably a little less replenishment than you would see given the results that you just saw in Q3. So part of that is certainly just more timing related as it relates to the two types of quarters we’re dealing with. There’s also some mix of business there, as well as some better terms with suppliers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley\nScott Devitt: Understanding there’s been unique volatility in business conditions in currency, when you gave first quarter guidance it was a range of 6% to 17%, then you did 14% and when you guided the recent quarter, you gave 11% to 23% and did 28%. I was just wondering if you could comment on your visibility into 4Q, given the still wide revenue range that you’ve given and the back-end loaded nature of the quarter, and the way that it seems business improved meaningfully throughout Q3, even after accounting for the September 15th event of last year.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I think the only thing I could say is we’re giving a wide range. The range is 21% to 36% growth on a dollar basis. We have reflected what exchange rates are recently which is approximately 500 basis points of impact, which would be 16% to 21%, and that wide range reflects, as I talked about a little bit earlier on the call, that uncertainty. That being said, we like what we saw in Q3 and as you also mention and inherent in your question, it is a back-end loaded quarter. It is very seasonal and December is by far our largest month in terms of overall revenue, and so it is all in front of us. That is why for us right now it is a very busy time as you can probably imagine, and we are focused very heavily on how do we make that experience as good as we possibly can for customers. We try to give guidance that reflects very good growth for the quarter but a wide range, given the uncertainty.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of  Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: A couple of questions -- you have hit the two-year mark for Amazon Prime in Japan and almost in Europe. Are you seeing the same type of frequency lift you saw with Prime in the U.S. in terms of magnitude of change in behavior? Second question, on FBA, are you seeing the ramp in FBA influence frequency as a whole on the business as you look at the U.S. market as you have better in-stock on products available from you guys?\nRob Eldridge: Consistent with what we have said, we are still very happy with the Prime programs worldwide. When we look at the international Prime programs, not only in Japan but also in Europe, we are seeing similarities in terms of subscriber growth as well as renewal rates. Across the geographies, Prime members tend to come to the site more often, shop with us more frequently and also explore more of the different stores. So you tend to see more cross-shopping. We are very, very happy with Amazon Prime across the globe. In terms of FBA, we think it is a win for the seller so we think it is a win for the customers. You saw in our results today that we still are seeing good growth with the FBA program here with where we are in this period of time. We are going to continue to put a lot of energy into both those programs for the benefit of our customers.\nJeetil Patel: Are those influencing frequency or attach rates?\nRob Eldridge: You are talking specifically about FBA?\nJeetil Patel: Yes.\nRob Eldridge: It is -- Again, I talk to you in the context of whenever you have the opportunity to deliver product to a customer in the United States with a guaranteed 2-day delivery or even faster if people are looking for express delivery, it is a positive thing for customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster: Back on the margin side, some of the things you have been changing within the business model in terms of private labels and the product adds, which conceptually carry a higher margin, is that starting to have an impact on margin or are they just too small to be adding up to anything?\nThomas J. Szkutak: We haven’t broken out the impact of either of those two but again in terms of private label, we certainly like that selection that we have but it is still a relatively small part of our overall selection. That is certainly something you can see by just browsing our website. You can look and it is still a relatively small part of the selection.\nGene Munster: Is there any growth in terms of the SKUs you have for private label you can disclose?\nThomas J. Szkutak: No, we haven’t -- you know, we aren’t breaking out any of the individual categories or also sales by vendor at all.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Pitts from UBS.\nBrian Pitts: A question on your shipping costs -- if you look, your outbound shipping as a percentage of sales was about 6% in the quarter. That is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. Are you seeing much better shipping efficiencies or is it really a function of higher digital media sales as part of that?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I think at the end of the day there is lots of factors that go into our shipping costs.  Part of what I think you are seeing during the quarter is we again saw good unit growth and we were able to leverage that sort of volume throughout the entire logistics chain.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heath Terry from FBR Capital Markets.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. Can you give us a sense of the traction that you are getting within the various components of Amazon Web Services? And then just to what extent that business as a whole is contributing to the margin out performance that we are seeing this quarter?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I’m sorry, Heath, I missed the first part of your question -- it was about?\nHeath Terry: Sure -- within Amazon Web services, the individual services that are available within that, which ones are you seeing the most traction with and have the highest level of expectations for?\nThomas J. Szkutak: It’s similar to the rest of our business, we don’t discuss the specific results of the different services. But we are seeing lots of demand around EC2 and S3 and SimpleDB. Developers use these services in different ways to create their own unique applications so we have a range of enterprise customers, start ups, academic institutions who are using AWS for a diverse set of use cases and using these building blocks to create unique solutions.  I think it’s very early with AWS but we’re very encouraged by the response that we’re getting from our customer base right now and we’re going to continue to innovate on their behalf. As I mentioned, part of the margin would certainly be part of the other revenue increase, some of the other things we talked about including marketing, Amazon enterprise services, web services, this would be larger pieces of the other.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions please -- the fulfillment leverage, I think that 8.1% as a percentage of revenue is the lowest you’ve ever had in the third quarter, so is there something that’s sustainable there?  Could you talk about whether that’s a base to think about it?  I know there’s seasonality in that line but that seemed to strike us as a bit of an outlayer. Secondly, international, you’re showing this accelerating international growth without the recession. We probably would have seen it the last couple of quarters.  Have you decided from now on you’re just going to ship your way to growth internationally and you don’t need to expand beyond the countries that you are in?  I only ask because you haven’t expanded to a new international market with a base station there in about four years but you seem to be doing fine without it, so is that the strategy from now on?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of fulfillment, the operations team has done a great job in improving our overall efficiencies and so you’re certainly seeing that reflect in our fulfillment.  One reminder as you look at fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue versus last year, last year we had just opened up three FCs and that’s reflected in the Q3 balance of last year in terms of expenses. In terms of international, no, you should expect to see that we will launch new geographies over time. What you’re seeing reflected in the growth right now is some of the things I talked about earlier, but we have added a lot of selection.  We’ve added a lot of new categories over the past couple of years and because of the opportunities we have in the existing countries that we operate in. So the team has done a great job at adding many new categories, adding selection within those categories, adding selection within the categories we are already in, making sure that we have great low prices and executing operationally, as well as certainly prime is helping us internationally as well, so all of those are combining in the results that you see. But no, you should expect to see more selection expansion going forward within the categories we are in, as well as geographical expansion over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Friedland from Cowen \u0026 Company.\nJames Friedland: A question as long as we’re on the topic of international, the Kindle going in to international markets, in terms of getting foreign language rights, what are the hurdles to achieving that especially in your core international markets like Germany?  What are the hurdles, what might be the timing to launch foreign language titles? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Certainly, it's an opportunity for us, and not unlike, you know, we have very good relationships with a lot of the publishers and content owners in the geographies that we operate in and certainly it's an opportunity for us over time to expand selection. Again, keep in mind from a Kindle perspective, our long-term vision is to have every title ever printed in any language available on Kindle in less than 60 seconds. It's certainly a big goal and something the team is certainly working towards.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Schachter from Broadpoint AmTech.\nBenjamin Schachter: Last quarter you called out video games as impacting the quarter and I was wondering if you could update us on how that category impacted this quarter. And then also, given the success of the Kindle, what are the types of criteria you use to decide any other types of devices you might try to sell directly to consumers? Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of video games, we are not breaking out any categories specifically this quarter, but what I would say is within media, we did see an acceleration in all of the key categories from Q2 to Q3. [inaudible] speculation on any other devices, I wouldn't want to speculate what we might or might not do there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal with Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, can you talk about contribution from any one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, i.e. any popular gaming or books title, or maybe pre-sale of Window 7 contribution? And then second is on Kindle -- can you talk about the linearity over the quarter? Did the lower price help you to hit maybe the tipping point sooner?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry, I missed the -- in your first question, you asked for any one-time items in the growth that we saw?\nSandeep Aggarwal: In the media segment.\nThomas J. Szkutak: I'm sorry, was there more to it? I missed the last part of that first question. I apologize.\nSandeep Aggarwal: That's all right, Tom. So I was -- basically I wanted to know the contribution from one-time items in your media segment during the quarter, such as pre-sale of Windows 7 or any popular gaming title, such as maybe the V-Sports Resort or any popular book titles.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Sure. We did see -- you know, it was -- we did see better releases than we've seen in previous quarters, particularly in the second half of the quarter, which is contributing to the growth that you see. But if you look at the growth that was essentially flat in Q2, to the 13% on a dollar basis of 14% on a local currency basis, the lion's share is not these-- some of the new titles that were out there, but certainly contributed to the growth rate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two quick housekeeping questions and one more [inaudible] question -- so in terms of the international gross margins, it seems like international gross margins are down 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. I tried to better understand what's driving that disparate growth in the third-party business. And secondly, user growth 17%, active user growth, can you help me understand, is it more tilted toward international or are you seeing broad-base growth? And more of a big picture question is regarding Web services -- it seems like talking to the developers that Amazon Web services is getting a lot of critics. Can you give us some sense, like what do you think is the gating factor that still only low-single digit percentage of IT spending is Cloud computing, why it's not moving faster?\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of international gross margins, one of the things certainly we are seeing is impacting it is lower prices to customers, changes in product mix. If you look at our EGM growth in Q3, it was up 58% on a local currency basis. That compares to 48% growth last year. International media was up 22% in the quarter, up 18% versus last year. So that mix of shift towards a higher percentage of EGM is certainly impacting gross margins in the quarter. That, between lower prices and change in mix, was partially offset by improvements in 3P as well as vendor pricing and inventory management. So that's really what's impacting gross margins. In terms of Web services, we are very optimistic about Web services. We have some great services that are getting some very good traction. It’s very early and the teams have done a great job in terms of executing on those services and making those reliable. There’s great pricing on those services and the team has continued to innovate in that space. So the team is very excited about it and we like what we see there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.\nJeffrey Lindsay: Will it be necessary as in previous years to significantly increase staffing for the holiday season, or do you think you’re already happy with current staffing levels? And then could you give us any kind of comment on how progress is going with [Goyo] Amazon, given [Cabo’s] recent payments to have 78% of e-commerce in China? Thank you.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of staffing, every year we supplement our teams and our FCs around the world with additional staffing and this year will be no different, and we’ve continued to add some capacity, particularly in international recently to get ready to serve our customers. In terms of [Goyo], we’re not breaking out in terms of giving any statistics on any of the growth in each of the geographies today but in terms of how we feel about [Goyo], we think our business in China is very good. We have a very good team there. Their focus is consistent with other geographies in trying to make sure that we have good customer experience and we think that China is a great long term opportunity and the team is working very hard on behalf of customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: I was wondering, given how much free cash flow you guys are generating, if you could just update us on your thoughts in terms of uses of cash and maybe how acquisitions fit into that, and then how you maybe think about whether to build versus buy when you think about product category expansion. Thanks.\nThomas J. Szkutak: In terms of use of cash, I wouldn’t speculate what we might do except for we still have an authorization for share repurchases, that there’s $900 million remaining on the authorization, so certainly that would be potentially part of our plans. When you think of acquisitions, we look at those opportunistically. It’s not something new. We’ve been looking at acquisitions for a number of years now and when we find ones that we like, we’ve done some to enter new geographies over time. We’ve done some where we think speed to market is important. We’ve done some where we like the team has a very specific skill set. So there are a number of different types of ones that we’ve done and there’s not much I can add to that. We will continue our focus there like we have over the past years and as there’s opportunities, we’ll certainly look at what makes sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: I wanted to focus on the book category, obviously a lot of press lately about the new pricing strategies. The question would be, as we think about our models, both from a sales and maybe even a margin perspective, near and longer term, how should we think about some of the changes that have been made in book pricing lately?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I’m sorry, could you repeat the second half of that question?\nBrian Nagel: I was saying as we think about models, and particularly in sales growth, or in margins, in books, how could the recent actions on book pricing affect those numbers?\nThomas J. Szkutak: I apologize. We haven’t broken out the growth rates or the margins of the book category. It’s included, the books margins would be included in our North America gross margins for those sales in North America and the corresponding ones in international. I think the way you should think about any of our categories is that we operate in competitive environments and that is something that has existed since the day we opened our doors. From our perspective, we are going to continue to focus on what is right for our customers and as I have mentioned a number of times on this call, and that is in all of our categories and all of our geographies, and so those are the things that because it is important to customers. In terms of also, when you talk about margins, one thing we clearly do is our focus is on primary [areas] is free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and so we focus on those operating profit dollars and free cash flow dollars and not individual margins.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Aaron Kessler from Kaufman Bros.\nAaron Kessler: First, any update on Checkup by Amazon? Clearly there seems to be some resistance from some pure play competitors and maybe expanding outside of their core retail market. I’m not sure if you commented but U.S. other revenues is up about 20% sequentially. I just wanted to see if you had an explanation for the strong growth in that category.\nThomas J. Szkutak: Checkup by Amazon is -- you know, it’s very, very early and the team is doing a good job there but it is very early and we think it is a nice opportunity and the team is executing well there but it’s -- again, it is very early for us. In terms of other, beyond what we have said already I don’t have a lot to add there. Certainly the pieces that roll into there are our web services business, which is getting good traction, our co-branded credit card arrangements, we have some promotional and marketing revenues, and then Amazon Enterprise Services. So those are the make-up of other and what is reflected in the growth that you are seeing there. We do have -- some of that revenue is promotional in nature or marketing in nature and can tend to be, as we have seen in some quarters, a little bit lumpy and so that is the only color I could add to it.\nAaron Kessler: On tax rate, any guidance for Q4? It has been jumping around somewhat this year.\nTom Szkutak: No. If you look at our year-to-date tax rate adjusted for any larger items would reflect our best estimate for the year at this stage.\nRob Eldridge: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

During today's call, I will review our third quarter financial results and provide guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2009. Jay will then discuss our commercial progress and provide an update on the state of our business and our markets. We recorded 158 million of total revenue for the third quarter, which was approximately $4 million below the low end of our guidance for the quarter. This represented 5% growth over Q3 of last year. Product revenue was 150 million growing 7% over the prior year period led by significant growth in our sequencing products. Then over to last quarter, the strong growth we recognized in our sequencing business was insufficient to offset declines in our microarray business, specifically for products that enabled genome-wide associations studies. Consumables revenue for the quarter was 87 million compared to 90 million in Q3 of '08 which represent a year-over-year decline of 4%. Sequencing consumables grew well over 100% on a year-over-year basis, but were essentially flat with respect to Q2. Late in the third quarter, we estimate that we lost approximately 68 million in revenue due to a sequencing reagent quality issue which prevented us from shipping certain kits at the end of the quarter. Jay will provide more details about this matter and its resolution in his remarks. Despite this issue annualized consumable pull through on the Genome Analyzer was still within our projected range of 150 to 200 K per system. Array consumables remain more than half of our consumable revenue but were down in the quarter on both the year-over-year and a sequential basis. The decline in array consumables continues to be directly attributed to the weakness in sales of whole-genome genotyping chips. Consumable pull through for the array business was between 400 and 500,000 per system. We shipped another record number Genome Analyzers during the quarter as demand for the system continues to exceed our expectations. Strong GA shipments as well as year-over-year and sequential growth in iScan revenue enabled us to recognize record instrument revenue of $61 million. This compares to 47 million in the third quarter of 2008 and represents year-over-year growth of 30%. Services and other revenue which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts was 8 million, compared to 10 million in Q3 of last year. The year-over-year decline in services was largely due to the overall decline in GWAS studies, but also to the fact that more of our genotyping service revenue has moved to our CSPro certified customers. Before discussing our gross margins and operating expenses for the quarter, I'd like to note that we recorded a pre-tax amount of $15 million related to non-cash stock-based compensation. This impacted our EPS by our tax adjusted amount of $0.07 per pro forma diluted share for the quarter. In my discussion of operating expenses, I will highlight both our GAAP expenses, which includes stock compensation expense and other non-cash charges and these corresponding non-GAAP figures. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that's included in today's earnings release. Total cost of revenue for the quarter was 51 million, compared to 57 million in Q3 of '08. The Q3 '09 cost includes stock-based comp expense of 1.3 million, compared to 1.2 million in the prior year period. Excluding the expense and 1.7 million associated with the amortization of intangibles non-GAAP gross margin was 69.5%. This compares to 70.6% last quarter and 64.6% in the third quarter of '08, a year-over-year improvement of nearly 500 basis points. Similar to last quarter, key contributors to the year-over-year gross margin improvement were our reformulated sequencing kits, our new real time analysis software package, which allows us to reduce the hardware cost in the Genome Analyzer. And overall manufacturing and supply efficiencies that have resulted in lower material costs and favorable overhead absorption. From a sequential perspective, gross margins declined by a 110 basis points from the second quarter, primarily due to the higher mix of instrument versus consumable revenue as well as the $2 million warranty reserves to account for the quality issues with our sequencing kits. As partially evidenced by our strong gross margins, pricing continued to be relatively stable in our markets. However, ASPs per example declined in the overall array market product line as due to an increase in the mix of customer and fix content shipments which sell for lower prices per sample relative to whole genome, genotyping chips. ASPs for whole genome genotyping chips were essentially flat with last quarter. Instrument ASPs and our sequencing business declined slightly from the second quarter as we closed more multi system deals, where we typically provide a larger discount. Research and development expenses were 34 million in the quarter, compared to 28 million in the comparable period of 2008 and included 4.8 million and 3.5 million respectively in non-cash stock compensation expense. Excluding stock compensation expense and 0.9 million and 0.6 million of accrued contingent conversation associated with the Avantome acquisition in the third quarter of 2009 and 2008 respectively. R\u0026D expenses were 29 million or 18.1% of revenue compared to 23 million or 15.6% of revenue in the prior period. The increase in year-over-year R\u0026D expense was primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased project activity. SG\u0026A expenses were 42 million, compared to 39 million in the third quarter of '08 and this includes stock compensation expense of 8.5 million and $8 million respectively. Excluding these non-cash expense, SG\u0026A was 34 million or 21.2% of revenue, compared to 31 million or 20.9% of revenue in the prior year period. The increase in SG\u0026A spend on a year-over-year basis is primarily the increase -- is the result of increased headcount. GAAP operating profit for Q3 was 29 million, excluding non-cash expenses outlined earlier and acquired in process R\u0026D expense of 1.3 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 48 million or 30.2% of revenue. This compares to 42 million or 28.1% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. This represents year-over-year operating profit growth of 13%, versus top-line growth of 5%. This demonstrates the continued underlying leverage of the business, in spite of lower than anticipated revenue figure. GAAP interest and other expenses of third quarter included approximately 4.8 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible debt. Excluding this amount, pro forma interest and other income was 3 million, which includes approximately 1.6 million or less than a penny per share of positive foreign currency effect due to the revaluation of monitory assets outside the U.S. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 36.4%, compared to 31.2% last quarter. The increase on our tax rate in Q3 relative to Q2 was due to the fact that we are generating more income from our sequencing products than we had originally forecast. This required us to make a year-to-date catch up adjustments that drove the tax rate higher, than originally expected. On an annualized basis, we anticipate our tax rate will be approximately 34%. We reported GAAP net income of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $10 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year period. The GAAP loss in the prior year period was due to the non-cash in-process R\u0026D expense associated with our acquisition of Avantome. Excluding the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense, non-cash interest expense and the other items identified in our press release and net of pro foma tax expense, non-GAAP net income was 32 million or $0.24 per pro forma diluted share, compared to 29 million or $0.22 per pro forma diluted share in the third quarter of 2008. This represents 13% growth in net income year-over-year. In the third quarter, we recorded capital expenditures of approximately 20 million. The largest component of this outlay was for the building improvements in our new UK facility. This facility is essentially complete at this stage and we will be moving in over the next few weeks. In the quarter, we generated $23 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $3 million or approximately $0.03 per pro forma fully diluted share. This compares to the third quarter of last year, when we generated $0.09 of free cash flow per share. Q3 cash flow compared to the second quarter this year was impacted by lower net income, increased inventory levels build to address the anticipated increase in demand for sequencing products and an increase in accounts receivable. DSO increased to 94 days, up from 87 days in Q2. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter were approximately 8 million and we ended the quarter with approximately 815 million in cash and investments. I will now provide financial guidance for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we will exclude the charges associated with the adoption of the accounting guidance related to convertible debt. Consistent with our previous calls, guidance will exclude certain non-cash charges including stock compensation expense, the amortization of intangibles and acquisition related charges. For additional details, please refer to the table in our earnings release that reconciled our non-GAAP guidance to the related GAAP figures. Not only did sequencing, the sequencing regent issue impact revenue in the third quarter, we expect that we'll have a negative impact of up to 15 million on Q4 revenue. As a result, for the fourth quarter we expect total revenues to be a minimum of 165 million, which implies a full year 2009 revenue at a minimum of 651 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 3% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. We expect gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter and full year to be between 69 and 70%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted pro forma share in the fourth quarter to be between 24 and $0.25, which implies a $1.5 to a $1.6 for the full year. We anticipate the full year pro forma tax rate will be approximately 34% and we will incur stock compensation expense of approximately 61 million or a tax adjusted amount of $0.31 per pro forma fully diluted share. The company expects full year weighted average shares for the measurement of pro forma amounts to be approximately a 133 million. And finally, we believe total capital expenditures will be approximately 52 million. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay for some remarks on our commercial activity during the quarter, before we begin our Q\u0026A session. Jay?\nJay T. Flatley: Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Q3 was a disappointing quarter for Illumina. The three key factors contributing to our revenue mix. First, the concerns that I discussed last quarter regarding stimulus related delays were realized. Second, we saw a continued decline in our whole genome and genotyping market. And lastly, we had rear operation this year occurred late in the quarter. Let me address these internally. As I described you last quarter, we felt that the ongoing uncertainties around the magnitude and timing of stimulus funding, our ability to forecast revenue. During Q3, only very limited stimulus funds were release to customers and we recognized a non-material amount of revenue from these funds. We estimated around 8 to $10 million of orders, we expected to receive were delayed waiting for grounds to be at work. Additionally, we did not see the bulk of orders at quarter end, it is typical for an end of NIH fiscal year. Grant approval activity accelerated significantly at the environment of September, and the NIH pushed to meet its fiscal year and deadline to commit -. While this is encouraging, it still remains significant uncertainty as to when these awards will convert to orders and ultimately be recognized as revenue. In Q4, we begun to receive some orders related to stimulus but cannot predict how much will hit Q4 versus sliding in to 2010. On the positive side, we no longer expect to see stimulus related spending delays impact our business. As we saw in the second quarter, a significant component of our revenue shortfall was due to the slowdown in genome-wide association studies or GWAS. GWAS revenue was $7 million below our internal forecast for Q3. The impact of this slowdown has been most significant in Europe, where the overall funding environment has lagged the U.S. The third factor contributing to our revenue shortfall was the sequencing reagent quality issue that Christian mentioned. Late in the third quarter, we experienced an issue with our paired and sequencing kit and estimated this problem alone resulted in lower third quarter revenue of between 6 and $8 million. I'd like to take a moment to walk you through exactly where we are with this issue and the impact we believe we'll have on the fourth quarter. In September, some of our customers began to see higher rates on the second period end analysis. As a result, we elected the whole shipment temporarily on all period end cluster kits, which we believe to be the cause of the failures in order to contain the problem and troubleshoot the cause. We tracked the root cause was small group of purchase materials and as since we formulated our kits with new raw materials. We've been testing the new kits extensively both internally and customer sides and believe that these new reagent patches are performing specifications. Additionally, we've enhanced quality control procedures to ensure that no additional defective kits are produced or shipped. We removed the shipping hold, we've ramped manufacturing and we expect to wrap up the clear backlog. This reactively holds shipments to contain the problem and will provide warranty replacement kits to our customers. Our revenue for the fourth quarter maybe negatively impacted by as much as $15 million. With this context, let me now discuss our product groups in the latest developments in each. Microarray products total revenue for the quarter came in under our forecast resulting in both sequential and year-over-year decline. The shortfall between our forecasted array revenue and the actuals for the quarter was primarily due to delayed orders as customers waited for funding. We expect to recognize many of these orders within the next two quarters and do not believe that we lost any material business to competition in Q3. Although, the overall array products declined in the quarter, both our custom and fixed content arrays continue to show significant growth. For example, we start growth of nearly 20% over last year and customers arrays and over 15% in our fix content products. However, this growth could not offset lower revenue from our whole genome microarrays. As we've mentioned over the past few quarters, the GWAS segment of the microarray market has been negatively impacted as researchers await new and rear end content from the project to be incorporated in to new array products. However, based on our discussions with customers and the number of stimulus grants awarded for GWAS subsequent to the close of the quarter, we believe the GWAS market will return to growth in 2010. Last week of the American Society of Human Genetics Conference, we announced our 2010 roadmap to deliver microarray products that will enable researchers to analyze up to 5 million variants per sample. The content for this product will come predominantly from the thousand genome project data as it is released. On the path -- the launch of the 5 million microarray, who will launch an intermediate 2.5 million variant products that were build upon the only one released in the second quarter of this year. We're collaborating with a group of leading researchers to prioritize markers as they released in the 1,000 Genomes Project, increasing content up to the 5 million microarray. Supplemental arrays that will allow customers to build towards the 5 million array incrementally. This approach will enable customers to begin their rich GWAS studies immediately with the only one and then purchase supplemental arrays at an overall level and total cost waited for the. We believe that this market approach will help to relieve deposit, we've seen in the market and begin to catalyze to broader merchants to rich GWAS. Our significant products start to gain expectations this quarter as we shipped a record number of Genome Analyzers. As at the end of the quarter, more than 70% of Biosystems in the field have been upgraded to the configuration. This upgraded the signs of improvements in our pipeline software has enabled multiple customers to now generate over 55 G per run on a single flow cell. We're also on track to meet our roadmap to generate 95 G per run around the end of the year. We continue to see the GA stand as the premier next generation sequencing system on the market. In fact, we believe that we currently have well over 50% share in the next gen sequencing market. Today there have been over 450 scientific publications using the Genome Analyzer more than 18 times greater than any others short lead sequencing technology. In addition of the hardware and software upgrades that we made in GA this year. Last week at AFHG, we announced the commercial launch and medium availability of, the next generation of our sample instrument. CBOT replaces the cluster station and enables greatly improved automation in front of the Genome Analyzer. This system is designed from the ground depth with great improving performance and ease of use. For example, the new system requires less than 10 minutes of hands on time and four hours of total runtime representing 70% and 20% reduction respectively compared to the cluster station. Compared to typical emulsion PCR protocols, CBOT requires 100, hands on time and 16, the runtime. Defending further, we already considerable sample prep time advantage. In addition to the improved performance, we completely redesign the user interface and the reagent cartridges. We've optimized the user experience by adding a touch screen interface to the instrument. Wireless users can now simple graphic icons to quickly get the samples processed and in addition, the system has integrated barcode reader for efficient tracking and logging of reagents. In conjunction with CBOT, we also launched our version 4 of cluster generation kits, which is a higher fidelity enzyme to deliver greater accuracy during amplification. These kits now come pretax and sealed for single step plug and play loading indices CBOT to help eliminate reagent prep areas and sources of contamination. Once the regents are loaded, the technician can walk away remotely monitor the run and receive diagnostic updates on any web enabled device including an iPhone. In the third quarter, we achieved record order levels. We built our backlog and maintained our strong gross margins. In manufacturing, we've continued to generate cost reductions and production efficiencies, which have resulted in gross margin improvement of almost 5% point last year. Prudent management of SG\u0026A expenses resulted in operating margins over 30% more than 2% points higher than last year, while maintaining significant R\u0026D investments to drive our product development portfolio. Overall, while we are disappointed with our total revenue performance in the third quarter, we are seeing many encouraging signs in our markets. Although, we have some remaining uncertainty about GWAS in Q4, we continue to gain confidence that growth will return in 2010. During the quarter, we saw significant increase in grants activity for GWAS, as well as custom content studies from both stimulus and related funding in the 2009 NIHB's budget. Next generation sequencing remains robust and continues to be the most exciting opportunity in the life sciences research area and we have maintained if not extended our market leading share during the quarter. Finally, our R\u0026D programs are richer than they have ever been supporting our core goal of delivering innovative products to our customers and our markets Thank you for your time and we'll now open the lines for your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We have a question from the line of Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Your line is open. Please unmute your phone, if you've muted your phone.\nRoss Muken: No, I am here. Hey guys.\nJay Flatley: Hey, Ross. So it seems like a confluence of things happened this quarter that were some were some were unexpected. I guess, the one that sort of stands out is obviously the sort of execution this Q on the manufacturing side. I mean when in the quarter did you realize that and when you saw that you were going to come up short relative to the guidance that you had set and what was the decision making process, particularly given it's impact not just for 3Q, but also for 4Q in terms of alerting the street versus sort of coming and doing it now in this forum?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. The earliest indicators we have Ross, were sort of in the early part of September, when we got one or two customers, who showed some aero weights (ph) and their second read, we'll began to investigate that. And sort of late in the September timeframe where we realized that we may have a reagent problem and we put a bunch of people on investigation of that problem to understand what was causing the problem. What was sort of the root cause of that issue and that's when we put a shipment hold on all of those paradigm kits. And so we spend sort of the next three to four weeks investigating that and building new kits from scratch with new raw materials. Which has proven to solve problems, we are very confident the reagents we're now shipping. But until we understood that we had the problem solved, it was very difficult for us to get a handle on our Q3 revenue, level on our Q4 revenue impact. And that's because we have some transactions, some business arrangements out in the field that has to do with the way that revenue gets allocated based on allocation to various kinds of shipments. We didn't exactly know what the warranty reserve is going to need to be. And so what is it really until last week that we had a handle on what the revenue number for Q3 would be and what the earnings would be for the quarter?\nRoss Muken: Okay. And as we look to the fourth quarter and to next year, I want to try to understand sort of the Firefox number, the guidance is extremely open ended relative to sort of setting a minimal level and obviously one can see what kind of the potential 50 million headwind what it is. If we sort of take that that sort of manufacturing issue which hopefully is now solved and kind of put that aside. I mean what is the sort of general backdrop look like for the performance of the business, once we sort of normalize for that in terms of what you are expecting in the fourth quarter relative to the stimulus. I mean you sort of earring on the side of caution there assuming most of those orders or clothes turn into revenues eventually in the first quarter, I mean I am just trying to get a sense for kind of the process there and then in turns what access kind of one-time issue and now that we should be a passed the point where the stimulus is freezing you out on the sequencing business, what's the sort of big picture look like?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. Well, a couple of factors; one is that for Q4 we pulled out roughly in a range of $10 million of GWAS from what we had guided to where we thought we were a quarter ago. And that was because of the continued decline that we saw in the third quarter. So fourth quarter, we're seeing some stabilization. We're not quite prepared to say that we're at a bottom of the decline in GWAS, we don't know. But we think we're sort of in that range now, but we took $10 million additional out for GWAS in the Q4. We've also because of delays in the flow of stimulus pushed $10 million of stimulus out of Q4 into next year from what we originally had estimated. We just don't know what the timing is going to look like of when these orders come in, when we then shift the product and we ultimately recognize revenue. And because of that uncertainty, we wanted to make sure that we didn't overestimate or pull in the stimulus more than it was really going to happen. So we are being cautious on stimulus. So far this year, it's been a negative for the company, we want to make sure that it wasn't a negative again in Q4.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please proceed.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon. So let me start with a follow-up to one of Ross' questions. Just to be clear on this, based on how you described it, is it fair to assume or is my understanding correct that you shift 6 to $8 million of debt where you didn't record revenues, given the reagent issue is that, is that how you came up with that estimate in terms of what the impact was in the quarter?\nJay Flatley: No, no Doug when we actually shut shipments off, we would have shipped 6 to 8 million more than the amount we're actually shipping out the door.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay.\nJay Flatley: And then there is also other orders that we would have -- there is other orders that we would have received that we know we would have received had we not had the issue in shift.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And so, I guess as a follow-up to that, there was no impact on instrument placements related to that. This is purely your estimate based on the reagent issue.\nJay Flatley: That's right.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And then moving forward is there any risk that this issue would impact negatively either new from a competitive standpoint of placing instruments or the time lines associated with placing instruments?\nJay Flatley: We don't think so. Most of our customers have continued to run, this was a problem that didn't occur on every run, occurred on a fraction of the run that customers were doing, putting our large production sites. We consider that to be an unacceptable situation. So that's where we begin working directly with those customers and have them stop running so that we could solve the problem. So we don't think that there has been an impact in the majority of customers, nor do we think there has been an impact on the order received rate for instruments. And we should say we're confident that we believe that we're over the problem.\nOperator: Okay. In the interest of time, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. We do have a question from the line Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMarshall Urist: Yeah. Hey, guys, good afternoon. So, I had a question on the other, kind of the other point you guys made about order delays. I think you said there were 8 to $10 million and I wasn't clear what you're saying there, was that orders that were delayed because of stimulus or those were stimulus orders that didn't come through because they didn't hear back from NIH in time?\nJay Flatley: It's really a combination of those things, and so when we put together our guidance for the quarter, we build up our sales pipeline from what we expected to close in the quarter and there was some mix of a little bit stimulus in there and there was some regular orders that we think were delayed because people might get stimulus money, so it's a combination of those two effects.\nMarshall Urist: Okay. Great, thanks.\nOperator: We have question from the line of Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.\nQuintin Lai: Hi, good afternoon. Going back to kind of the GWAS discussion, you said that European sales also impacted you. They are not going to be impacted by NIH stimulus, so could you explain the little bit about how you expect that to come back to growth. And is there a source of funding for them that's going to get them back for next year?\nChristian Henry: We think, as in the U.S., Quintin the reduction that we saw in Europe, across the world there is sort of slower economic environment, coupled with a specific impact in GWAS. In Europe, there is no stimulus, you're right? So that won't be a positive affect bringing that back. But we do think as GWAS recovers that the funding mechanisms that are replacing Europe will fund next generation of GWAS studies. So we don't have much concern about that. We do have as we mentioned in the past quarter or two, some key foundations funding NAVs in Europe that has gone down considerably in their array business as those endowments have suffered over the past few quarters.\nQuintin Lai: Okay, as a follow-up to that, the preliminary discussions that maybe some of your customers have shared with you on the future of GWAS, could you talk a little bit about what kind of population sizes that they are looking at, are they are going to be comparable or bigger than the previous ones and then with respect to price per sample, I mean do you anticipate it being a little higher now that you are going to go to 2.5 or 5 million snips per sample?\nJay Flatley: Yeah, we think the population sizes will be larger and that's driven by the statistics of the fact that we are dealing with low frequency variants that to get statistical significance you need larger populations and so, a study that might have historically been around 2,000 samples may now require 5 to 6,000 samples. In terms of pricing, we do think that 2.5 m and the 5 m prices will be higher on a sample basis than say we are charging for the OMNI today, so that will definitely be an increase in per sample prices. Obviously, we can command that because the content will we much rich.\nQuintin Lai: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.\nBill Quirk: Thanks, good afternoon. Jay, not be there for sure but, just I guess one last question if you could just some reagent issue. The correction sounded a lot like it was just requiring new raw materials and then maybe some improved quality control internally. But in terms of the overall manufacturing process, there is no meaningful changes above and beyond that correct?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. This wasn't a process problem it is the raw material problem. And so, what've done is we've isolated it down to one of three raw materials. We now have very expensive incoming quality control checks on those over and above that we have already. And we are testing every lab that we produce. And so we don't think that the problem will recur. But, this really was a not a failure in how we were making new reagents. It was a failure of incoming material.\nBill Quirk: Okay. Now, it's very clear. And then also just thinking about a stimulus, now we've got a pretty good handle on a lot of the awards and some of the actual funding timelines here. How should we thinking about the initial stuff and 10 expectations?\nJay Flatley: Well, we are still trying to figure out what that timing is going to look like but we think we have a better handle now on the scope of the opportunity and we think that initial committed funds which about half of the 10 billion that NAH was going to receive in stimulus that the alumina opportunity set there is somewhere a $100 million or 100 million plus, we might not give all of that, because obviously there is some competition for those funds. But there are opportunity -- is of that magnitude and we suspect in the second phase of committed grants that there will be some additional upside to that number, sometime through 2010, 2011. What we are still uncertain about, is exactly how fast those moneys will flow? What the allocation between instruments and the agents will look like and therefore we are not at a point where we can assign them with those opportunities on a quarterly basis yet. But clearly, we do expect a positive affect on 2010.\nBill Quirk: Very good. If I can take one last one and here for Christian, in terms of the rising DSO anything we should worry about here Christian or is this is a function of timing?\nChristian Henry: No, it's a function of timing actually. If you look at the actual ageing buckets in terms of the delinquent accounts. The ageing relative to last quarter is actually looking better. So it's really due to the timing of when you do the emblazing and things like that. So from my perspective, we are watching it carefully of course. But our cash have been good and our write-offs are non existent. We don't really have any write-offs and I font think it's -- I think about it but I am not that worried about at this point.\nOperator: We have question from the line of Derik De Bruin, UBS. Please proceed.\nDerik Bruin: Hi. So, I guess when you kind of look at some of the new content, GWAS chips that are going to be out there and then as people kind of gear up to do the studies. I guess, given that given disappointed and some of the results from the first round of studies. I mean when do they think the content is going to be rich enough in order that we again the next round of studies, I mean are they going to. I mean do you see that something happening by middle of 2010, do they think or how we find enough data from the projects and then start going, or they going to wanted to be more and more stuff coming out from that. I guess at what point do you think some of your big labs are going make that go, no go decisions I think big projects.\nChristian Henry: I don't think the decisions, our customers will be binary and universal. I think there'll be, we make the decisions about what their best strategies will be? Now of been on what their research program looks like and where they are in their phase of study? One of the reasons we put forward our roadmap is because, it's very clear that even if you had say the first chip of 25 million mark impact or even the if you ran those chips, you have some probability of discovering some very important markers in the low hanging fruit because the initial markers that we will put on, the 2.5 million chip will be the best set of markers out of the 20 million that have come out of the 1000 genome program. And so they will have the highest opportunity in making the next set of discoveries. The way we've set out the program then allows someone to begin using the then run the series of supplement chips, two supplemental chips in that case to get up to the and our hope is that, some customers will begin to start even now in the or when we launch the 2.5 and then we'll run the supplemental chips to get up to the five. With the that they have an opportunity of making some very important discoveries early on, as opposed to waiting until the 5 m was fully available. And we priced those supplemental chips to inset customers to take that path. So that's part of the marketing approach that we've taken on this program.\nDerik Bruin: Okay. I guess is there concern of this, the researchers won't have enough raw sample to go back and do to repeat studies, I mean just given the, have difficulty as foundation sample in ?\nJay Flatley: No, they are in pretty good shape in most of the populations and most of the diseases and many of the projects that we saw even in the last phase were came together around the world to do the programs and so we don't think there will be a limitation on samples and since stated the last round many of these groups have continued to collect samples on an ongoing basis and get some R\u0026D.\nDerik Bruin: Good. One minute a quick one, we heard a lot of chatter about some large awards, some of the genomes, some of the large genome. Could you give any color on sort of happened to date about some of the large systems orders, can you but its what's out there so far?\nJay Flatley: Well, we haven't given any information out about that. And as we've said before if we get an order that we think is substantial and material we'll press release that at the appropriate time.\nOperator: We have a question from line of Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan Please proceed.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good afternoon. The 10 million I think you talked pointing out GWAS for the fourth quarter, does that include a service component. And if not, what take as to prevent service from having a third quarter and the fourth quarter?\nChristian Henry: Well the service is impact is too fold. One is the overall reduction in GWAS studies and secondarily, I think we've mentioned now three or four quarters running the fact that more and more that business is going off to our CS core customers. And that's the trend that we think is okay. Our sales team has enabled our customers to run these service projects. And we've encouraged them in fact to develop by automatic analysis on the backend that we don't offer. And so that migration is one we're fine with. And so from a GWAS growth opportunity in our own services business, that's not something we're measuring as strategic to Illumina's progress.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you talk a little bit about capital deployment, you've got a new buyback. How we think about balancing that with some of the investments you've made in new technology versus infrastructure?\nJay Flatley: I think we're generating sufficient cash. So we're looking -- we're putting into the business, you see the R\u0026D, we're still spending quite an R\u0026D. We have a very extensive project set. And you're right; we do have the buyback in place, out certain place largely that recovers the dilution from the stock option programs. And basically a carry forward from the buyback that we announced, I believe it was last year and so then on the capital spend side, we are just wrapping up our building in the UK, which is a very significant expense in the quarter, it was a little bit -- a little more than $10 million of the 20 million was spent that area alone. And at that point, most of our scale is complete and for at least the foreseeable future. So, I think from a CapEx perspective, you'll see the CapEx moderate in 2010.\nChristian Henry: We have no other material building programs underway, you were taking some small incremental space first or San Diego but that's routine, so resold improvements nothing significant in the next year to 18 months.\nJay Flatley: And then our strategic investments Tycho, that's probably better, we don't really kind of signaled those until we make them, but of course we're always looking a technology opportunities, with me moving into my new role, it's going to give us an opportunity to focus a little more deeply in that area, so stay tuned.\nOperator: A question from a line of Isaac Ro, Leerink Swann. Please proceed. And your line is open, if you've muted your line, please unmute your line.\nIsaac Ro: Sorry. Thanks, for taking the questions, just looking at the fourth quarter guidance of 155 million in reps. I just want to make sure that where do you see that number excludes any impact from the larger orders we talked about last quarter. I think you mentioned that you had coupled potentially $40 million size orders, it was a multitude caused by the $10 million size orders, potentially out there, was a stimulus. And I want to make sure the extent to which you pulled all those types of potential orders out of the expectations at this point. And then maybe the extent to what say might provide optionally the upside should they materialize this quarter?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. We clearly think what we said that there were some grants as large as $40 million. And clearly, somebody got to grant all that money, wouldn't necessary go to us. But there was some large grants in the queue, as we seen reported, since the end of the third quarter. And what we've done is we've factored in some expectations of what might happen statistically across that set of grants for the fourth quarter. But in general, what we've seen is a little slower processes than I think many people anticipated six months ago with the commitments really coming around the end of the third quarter. And some dribbles of money hitting researchers now. And so, it's hard for us to predict any specific grants for fourth quarter revenue and so we haven't included any specific, but rather taken some statistical expected value across the whole opportunity set.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Dan Leonard, First Analysis. Please proceed.\nDan Leonard: Hi, good afternoon.\nJay Flatley: Hi.\nDan Leonard: So, I guess my question is why this point didn't you more visibility and which you will capture from the stimulus, given that a lot of grants -- have been awarded and since there was somebody's requesting an instrument, my understanding is often times on the instrument on plus.\nJay Flatley: We have very creditability at that level. So we have been through every single grant that's been awarded. We have analyzed, we've read every abstract, we've categorized them, we know which are arrays, which are sequencing, which ones have Illumina's name in them, which ones don't. So that parts on ambiguous now, at least for the first half of the committed grants. What is ambiguous is the timing and so we don't know when those grants will transfer into orders for Illumina. And all of them or many of them have to go through administrative processes, there is institutions, there is negotiation periods to get the orders closed and in some cases there is revenue recognition issues. So whether they fall into Q4 or into 2010, this is where the largest uncertainty is.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then from my follow-up question on the sequencing consumables issue again, how is the fourth quarter revenue impact twice the third quarter level?\nJay Flatley: Because we start shipment of reagent kits probably around the third week of September, somewhere in there. And into fourth quarter, we started shipping last week and so we had more aggregate weeks of hold on those reagent kits in the fourth quarter and the greater number of customers affected as the problem went forward. More time, and more customers. The other factor of course is that for some of the customers that were affected we're now supplying them with replacement kits, the ones they had issues with. And so for the next weeks, they'll be running one in the factor three kits.\nOperator: And we have question from the line of Zarak Khurshid, Caris \u0026 Company. Please go ahead.\nZarak Khurshid: Yes, Zarak Khurshid, Caris \u0026 Company. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJay Flatley: Hey, Zarak.\nZarak Khurshid: I'm curious about the array roadmap, so to get to the 5 million variants engineering wise, what do you actually have to do differently to the OMNI chip?\nJay Flatley: It's straightforward, so there is no technical risk there. It's a factor of content timing. We already have the OMNI-Quad chip which in affect has that number of markers on it and so we simply have to change the gasket into make that into a 5 million variant arrays. So there is no change required on the ship format, simply changing the gaskets. What we do, of course have to do is decide on the content. And then simplify the algos and make that equal. So there is some timing, sequential timing until we can actually get the array manufacture.\nZarak Khurshid: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up just for fun I'll ask about the reagent issue again. So, does this miss that change anything with respect to the plan GA throughput improvements for this year or next year? Thank you.\nChristian Henry: We don't think it will have a material impact, we were slowed down a little bit in our testing, in our R\u0026D, but we think that is going to be measured in weeks not months. So it could been delay by some number of weeks, but this s not material.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Davis Bu, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nDavis Bu: Hi, thanks. I had a question and then follow-up. Kind of related to the mix of businesses. The first is on the tax side, so if I understand that the reason that the tax rate was a little bit, was that because of the manufacturing outside the United States and the Singapore plant, and if so longer term, do you have plans to ship sequencing products -- manufacture sequencing products outside United States?\nChristian Henry: Yes, you are right. Most of our sequencing products, actually all of our sequencing products are manufactured either in California or some components are manufactured in the UK and consequently as the sequencing business has become a greater proportion of our total income relative to our expectations, the tax rate's gone up accordingly, because we're not getting the benefit of Singapore. It is our intention to move more and more products to Singapore and we're doing that in a step wise fashion, basically looking at the highest value products to keep moving to Singapore, so in 2010, you'll start to see some of our sequencing products be manufactured out of Singapore. And also remember that the tax rate this particular quarter was a little bit higher because we had to make a catch up adjustment, basically a year-to-date adjustment given where we're forecasting the sequencing business, or the income from sequencing to come out relative to the array income at this point.\nDavis Bu: Thanks. And on a related matter, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what the mix looks like this past quarter and what it can look like in 2010. And is there are any other downstream affects other than tax, for instance on margins or anything else that we should be thinking about in terms of the mix of businesses?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. We don't typically break out the each of the different product areas. One thing we didn't say in my remarks was that array consumables are still higher than sequencing consumables, but of course on the year-over-year basis, sequencing consumables grew over a 100%. So the sequencing business is definitely in a gaining on the array business right now, but we don't breakout the specifics.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of John Groberg, Macquarie Capital. Please proceed.\nJonathan Groberg: Hi. Good afternoon. Jay, can I just understand this migration again and so someone buys an OMNI chip, do they then have to buy the two supplemental arrays and may come behind it or how is the price, how does this work from like a pricing standpoint?\nJay Flatley: They don't have to buy them, but they have the opportunity to buy them. So, some who really chip, every only chip that a customer buys, they can then buy the follow-on supplemental chips. And those supplemental chips are not the 2.5 and the 5. They are the incremental piece, to get you to 5. So, they essentially have the right to buy those incremental chips. And a total aggregate cost all the way through the process and slightly less than it got the 5 amp.\nJonathan Groberg: Okay. So, it's all end of cost of doing that to them is something it would less than if they waited for the just for the 5 amp?\nJay Flatley: Yeah. That's right and we've done explicitly to try to capitalize the market to get going here and to not to wait. Because there are great discoveries waiting to be made on every incremental content that becomes available from thousand genome program and we didn't want to happen as earlier question alluded to for 5 million variant chip to get started. And so that's marketing program is intended to address.\nOperator: There we have a follow up question from the line of Derik De Bruin, UBS. Please proceed.\nDerik Bruin: Did I message or did you give us the brief breakout for instruments and consumalres in the other in terms of specific by 61 million for the instruments, I didn't get the change for the other.\nJay Flatley: Yeah consumables revenue, I believe was 87 million.\nDerik Bruin: Okay. And the other about 2.7 million.\nChristian Henry: Yes, give or take.\nDerik Bruin: Okay, did you know whether I got a couple of question from clients out wanting to know where the source of the raw materials were?\nChristian Henry: We're not going to disclose that.\nDerik Bruin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We have another follow up question, this is from the line of Doug Schenkel. Please proceed.\nDoug Schenkel: I have a -- I guess three, what I think, well two quick follow ups and I guess the third one which may take a little bit longer. Can you guys just talk about and I apologize if I missed it. What's the expected negative gross margin impact in the fourth quarter specific to reagent issue?\nJay Flatley: Dough, we've already taken a warranty for it. So from a warranty perspective, we've already taken that accrual. From -- if we achieve, I guess what you need to look at is the guidance we actually gave was 69 to 70% for the quarter and for the year. So I don't expect it to have a big impact on the quarter.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And then when do you expect the GA annuity string to rebound and what direction are you assuming for Q4 and I guess in terms of what's incorporated into guidance. I am just trying to get out, whether we should be thinking about the annuity string dropping a little bit sequentially and bounce back?\nJay Flatley: A little bit because we had a couple of weeks here with actually we shipments to some many large customers and there sort of and gradually get back into this and there will be running some warranty reagents, and so there will be some impact. But if you were to say start to map around in the middle of November, I think then will be back up to a run rate, we would expect.\nDoug Schenkel: And then Q1 were back to normal 200 plus.\nJay Flatley: We have been saying 150 to 200. You are right, in the second quarter we were closer to that, at that high end and we didn't at that high end.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And last one, not to rub -- in the room here but this the second quarter in a row where you have missed and this time based on the emails I am getting there is lot of frustration about, the lack of visibility and questions about whether you should have preannounce or not; given this and I am sure this doesn't come as a surprise to you, can you please talk about how comfortable with the target you are relative to the past two quarters?\nJay Flatley: Yeah and I can understand why people are frustrated and we're frankly frustrated as well. I am clearly not happy with our results and our ability to forecast. We've done everything, we know how to do to get clarity around the impact of stimulus and the reduction in GWAS. We've done, I think everything we could have done to get a handle on that and it just didn't turnout exactly as we had hoped here as we had assumed. I think the guidance that we gave is the most responsible guidance that we could come up with, as a minimum number we think that there are ways to have upside to that number but our visibility under degree to that upside is limited and that's why we choose interestingly to not give a high end of the range as we typically do. And we didn't want to bound it very narrowly, because we thought that might indicate that, more procession in the forecast and in fact we do. So what we think the 165, minimum numbers, the most responsible number that we could arrive at.\nOperator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn call back to Peter Fromen for closing remarks.\nPeter Fromen: Thank you, operator.

NFLX~2009~4~324~1277~1/28/2010~.23985706~.21284525~.20995885~.21696265~-3.6848631~-4.0931168~-3.7566454~-3.7353625~1~Operator: Welcome to the Netflix fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I this time I will turn things over to Ms. Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.\nDeborah Crawford: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Netflix’s fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. We released earnings for the fourth quarter at approximately 1:05 p.m. PT today. The earnings press release and the webcast of this conference call are available at the company’s Investor Relations Website at ir.netflix.com. In addition, as noted in the earnings press release, management’s commentary on the quarter’s results is also available at our Investor Relations website. This conference call will consist solely of Q\u0026A. As we have done for the past several quarters we are going to conduct Q\u0026A via email. Please email your questions to me at dcrawford@netflix.com. We may make forward-looking during this call regarding the company’s future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2009. A rebroadcast of this call will be available at the Netflix website after 6:00 p.m. PT today. Before moving into Q\u0026A I would like to turn the call over to Reed for some brief opening remarks.\nReed Hastings: Thanks Deborah and welcome everyone to today’s call. As you can tell from our press release and from our commentary we posted on our website, Q4 was a great quarter. Over one million net new subscribers, strong earnings and a significant expansion in streaming. As our guidance for 2010 indicates we expect the momentum to continue. With that let’s go directly to Q\u0026A.\nDeborah Crawford: The first question comes from the line of Steve Frankel – Brigantine Advisors.\nSteve Frankel: Is the bounty paid to the game platform manufacturers materially different than that paid to other customer acquisition channels? Is it higher or is it lower?\nReed Hastings: We don’t disclose individual deals as you probably would expect. But what you can see is that as we have expanded with the various CD platforms including the game platforms that our subscriber acquisition cost has continued to come down nicely. From that you can intuit there is no significant model shift.\nSteve Frankel: Is the decline in SAC driven by more decline in ad rates, increased brand awareness or a reduction in the bounty you are paying for customer acquisitions?\nReed Hastings: Mostly brand awareness and the improvement in the product. The product fundamentally the service is better than it was 2-3 years ago because of the streaming. So that increased attractiveness makes it easier to sell, if you will, that combined with the large scale we are operating at is what is driving down the SAC as opposed to some change in the display ad markets or outside factors.\nSteve Frankel: With HBO, Starz and Showtime so focused on original programming do you expect as their respective studio output deals come up for renewal they will be less willing to lay out large amounts of cash, potentially opening up content for you to acquire?\nReed Hastings: On the first part they have had great success with episodic first HBO then Showtime and most recently Starz where Spartacus just launched and is a huge success for Starz. It hasn’t lowered their appetite for movies. As an example, HBO pioneered episodic probably 7-9 years ago and has continued to renew their deals and be very focused on movie content. We are focused on being a distributor for those services. We are a distributor for Starz now. We would like to be for Showtime, HBO and Epics. That is the relationship that we want as opposed to trying to bid against them. That is just not necessary for us.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali – Jefferies \u0026 Company.\nYoussef Squali: Will you be renegotiating content rights with the studios along the lines of what you have done with Warner Bros. for [day and date] releases? Help us understand the cost benefit to you.\nReed Hastings: I will broaden the question flatly to the 28 day question which is why did we do the Warner deal. I don’t think it impacts the streaming directly. With Warner Bros. they wanted to create a window to improve sell through. As you well know in the book industry there is hard cover books for awhile and then paperback. That is a proper profit maximization strategy. They, and I think quite reasonably, would like to have DVDs for sale at Amazon, Wal Mart, Best Buy, etc. for some period of time before they are available for rental. We were willing to agree with them to work within that system which we hope and they hope will improve DVD profits and the DVD ecosystem. For us most consumers are not sure if DVDs come 90 days after the theatrical release, 120 days, 150 days, 180, it is all over the map. It constantly changes not only between studios but also between specific releases. So there is not a high expectation of any perfect day when it is supposed to be out. There is potentially competitive risk if Redbox and others continue to be able to have availability [day in date] and it certainly appears that Warner is going to try and do, and the other studios, is to have us and the kiosks ultimately at the 28 day which creates the window for the studios. Video stores we are not sure what will happen there but they are closing so quickly it may not be that relevant in the next couple of years and kiosks and rental by mail together could create that window. The advantage to us in doing the deal is cost savings. Warner has given us a huge number of copies up to 29th day at a very attractive price so we are able to fulfill all of the consumer demand and then we are able to use those savings to pour that into more streaming content. It is really a win all around in terms of what we are doing and that is why we are looking forward to expanding with other studios over the next two years as our deals come up.\nYoussef Squali: The Wii deal, what is the percentage of the total Wii installed base that is actually addressable in that relationship? Arguably you need connectivity to stream content which many older devices don’t have.\nReed Hastings: Well that is actually one of the amazing things about the Wii. 100% of the devices of WiFi include [inaudible] of the 26 million installed base 100% are addressable by Netflix. So we are very excited about that.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Ralph Scharkar – William Blair.\nRalph Scharkar: Can you talk about Netflix’s digital content acquisition strategy as it relates to new content? In other words, is it possible to get digital content closer to DVD release or possibly longer term getting DVD windowing rights? What are the business model pros and cons for offering newer digital titles?\nReed Hastings: We are not terribly likely to have equipped with the DVD streaming content in newness in the service. That is true for frankly any subscription service including HBO, Starz, etc. so the biggest advantage that Netflix has competitively is we can offer this subscription for the new releases on DVD and a vast catalog is potentially available for streaming. We fit into the subscription TV window in studio [par widths] which is the same window with HBO, Starz and others and within that there is a lot more content we can get that we haven’t yet licensed which is fundamentally us writing bigger and bigger checks to be able to purchase more and more content which is coming along nicely. I would say the strategy is not particularly focused on how do we break through to get the newest new releases on streaming. It is much more how do we get every TV episode, every movie ever made, that catalog, an incredibly rich catalog and then to use our personalized merchandising to figure out which parts of that are relevant to each consumer so that when they turn on their TV or they go to the Netflix website the 20 or so movies listed are 20 movies that consumer is just dying to watch.\nRalph Scharkar: Can you talk about the subscriber? How did this quarter in terms of how many were purely streaming digital subscribers? Perhaps more broadly, are you seeing any measurable mix shift to subscribers renting less DVDs and converting to streaming only?\nReed Hastings: All of our subscribers pay for hybrid service so they get both DVD and streaming. Nearly all of them also take DVDs. So they really use both and again on DVD we have over 100,000 titles so it is just incredibly comprehensive. You can see why someone would do that. In terms of the substitution question you asked, our long-term model is to be able as a percentage of our costs to pay a little bit less each year on DVD and Blue-ray as a percentage and to put more and more money into streaming. That is eventually where you will see this substitution. We are not able at this point to be conclusive about any substitution that exists because we don’t have a good control set of subscribers that don’t get streaming. So when we look at it we are very happy with the effect streaming is having but it is mostly coming in terms of additional growth. That is the one where we see it directly where it gets lower SAC and lower turn. More than it is a cost substitution. As you can tell from our P\u0026L margin structure we are able to get enough digital content to have significant expansion in streaming and we are moving along each quarter in getting more and more content.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler – Kaufman Bros.\nAaron Kessler: It doesn’t appear you were as aggressive as you would have liked to have been in terms of purchasing digital content in 2009. What prevented you from acquiring the rights to more content in 2009? What is the outlook for availability of content in 2010 and any comments or concerns with studio thoughts on Starz licensing digital content to Netflix?\nReed Hastings: There are a couple of key questions in there. We are very happy with the content that we have been acquiring. It is a small part of the content for streaming we eventually want to have but it is enough content that the percentage of subscribers viewing or streaming has significantly increased. In one quarter we went from 41% to 48% of our subscribers and remember the subscriber base is growing over that time also. I know we don’t have everything that we want but we have a ton of content for subscribers and they are super happy with it. Again, as we write checks and are able with a larger P\u0026L to write larger checks we get more and more content. In terms of Starz specifically and Starz Disney we don’t have any reason to believe there is going to be any change in that in the short-term. That is working well for us. We have a good agreement in place. In terms of long-term we are not dependent on any one content source particularly. The strength of Netflix is to have a very broad range of content. So we are not particularly troubled by those press reports.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me supplement Reed’s answer with perfect foresight we have been able to forecast the profit performance of the business and the subscriber growth we would have landed within the range of guidance. We would have spent to acquire content roughly the amount of money we had forecast. The business outperformed and we weren’t able to forecast that accurately and as a consequence we dropped more profit to the bottom line in Q4 than we had planned. If we had planned for it we would have managed to the 10% number and spent more on content. So perhaps your question in part is the weight of the outperformance in the quarter and that narrowly is a planning related issue.\nReed Hastings: That is a great point Barry. For investors typically, it is all a little variable, but it is at least six months from when we start to talk with a studio or network about a particular set of content to when a deal is signed and the content is flowing. So it is not stuff you call up and 30 days later you spent more money on the P\u0026L. So these are long-term deals and each one takes quite awhile to negotiate. At any point in time we are in negotiation on a very broad range of content.\nAaron Kessler: How did PS3 launch compare to Xbox 360 realizing you can’t give any specific numbers?\nReed Hastings: PS3 was a huge success for us. Its advantages are that it has WiFi built into every unit. You can use Netflix without being part of an add-on subscription like [Gold]. The disadvantages are that it has a disc and we have to mail the disc to the consumer. Once they have the disc then it is very easy to use but that does introduce a delay. We are super happy with the traction the PS3 has had. Then in the fall we will be offering a downloaded option directly in the PS3 to the PS Network.\nAaron Kessler: What data are you looking at that suggests streaming is the big reason for lower churn, i.e. exit surveys?\nReed Hastings: No, we are actually looking at retention data, the inverse of turn for specific cohorts of customers segmented by behavior. So there is some portion that don’t stream. There is some portion that gets in hybrid behavior. There is some portion that streams only. I am looking at year-over-year comparisons in Q4 of retention behavior by subscriber period. First month and the individual months after that over their entire life.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst – Hudson Square.\nDaniel Ernst: Roku says they have sold 500,000 boxes, an impressive number. I assume most of those have connected to Netflix. If I added up all of the direct TV options you have; Roku, LG, Samsung, Sony, Xbox, etc. can you give me a sense of how many direct to TV Netflix homes there are?\nReed Hastings: I can’t give you a direct sense. For one thing there are many people who use a laptop and then use a HDMI cable to the TV. That shows up as laptop usage. Then there is the class of Mac Mini’s where people do a similar thing and it shows up to us as a computer usage that goes to the TV. So you really don’t want to think about it as the screen size. If the screen size is 12 inch in one category. If the screen size is 36 inch it is a different category. So when we thought about this over the last year we came up with a metric for your benefit and the benefit of investors which is the percentage of subscribers that we are streaming in the quarter and taking advantage of it. Again, the actual screen size is not the main factor.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Michael Pachter – Wedbush Morgan Securities.\nMichael Pachter: Subscribers grew by 2.88 million in 2009 yet guidance for subscriber growth ranges from 3.23 million to 4.03 million. Does this guidance incorporate the introduction of the streaming only service during the year and if so would you please break out by mail subscribers expected compared to streaming only?\nReed Hastings: There is no formal plan, nor is it included in our guidance to introduce streaming only. Nor do I think it would change the forecast. In other words, if we thought it would open up an entirely new market of course we would do it. So we look at it and from our work with our subscribers and at $8.99 the hybrid is just so incredibly powerful that for now we are just going to ride that horse, concentrate on the brand proposition on that.\nBarry McCarthy: One minor caveat by way of cleanup, the sub guidance is for domestic and international. International is very small. International will be streaming only. Domestic will not have a streaming only product. I want to emphasize international is very, very small.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Mario Cibelli – Marathon Partners.\nMario Cibelli: Could you break down at all where streaming is coming from? PC, Xbox, Blue-ray players, Roku, etc.? If not, are there any standouts in the mix that might be of interest to you?\nReed Hastings: All of the devices you would think are significant that have big installed bases which are laptops, Windows and Macintosh and game consoles are very big. The next big category are Blue-ray because we got started early and that is continuing to grow really well for us. When we look at 3-5 year picture, being built into the TV is an obvious winner. We think that most TVs, almost all Blue-ray players sold this year in 2010 will have internet connectivity and Netflix. A substantial faction of TVs will have internet connectivity and almost all of those will have Netflix. Within 2-3 years my sense is WiFi is so inexpensive to add to TVs that they will be in every screen and we believe that Netflix will be part of that. So the long-term picture really driven by TVs, Blue-ray, but in the short-term video game and laptops are big contributors also.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Ben Rose – Battle Road Research.\nBen Rose: Will Netflix simply absorb the gross margin improvements that occur to a rising percentage of streaming versus DVD shipments or can we expect the purchase of new Hollywood productions to offset such gross margin gains?\nReed Hastings: Hopefully we will see it coming in which case we will reinvest it in improving the quality of the user experience in more content.\nBarry McCarthy: At least this year, we are targeting 11% operating margins and we will take it year by year. There is a pretty big prize out there and if we can reinvest additional margins essentially saved into more content that seems the smarter thing to do in the next few years.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of  Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial Group.\nMarianne Wolk: The year-over-year decline in SAC was much lower than we have seen in the last few years. Should we anticipate positive growth in marketing spend per subscriber going forward and how does the marketing for Wii affect this?\nReed Hastings: If you look over the last 3-4 years marketing has declined as a percentage of revenue each year and as our revenue grows we think that will continue to happen including the special Wii marketing we will be doing. So that is included in our model.\nBarry McCarthy: Returning back to Reed’s comment earlier in the call, he observed one of the drivers of declining SAC was the organic growth which was tied to the quality of the service. To the extent we are able to improve the content offering and be the beneficiary of more platforms capable of streaming content to TV sets that should be a boost for organic growth which would be a plus for subscriber acquisition costs.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald – UBS.\nBrian Fitzgerald: It looks like your DVD library is pretty consistent at about 100,000 titles while streaming titles are up from roughly 12,000 in the summer to 17,000. How should we expect that to grow going forward? Would you expect 30,000 by year-end?\nReed Hastings: I should have avoided publishing the 17,000 update because it gets everyone focused on title count and you can imagine we could quickly license if we wanted to 100,000 irrelevant titles. So you really don’t want to use title count as a proxy for attractiveness of the service. If we had 1,000 of the biggest titles that would make a much bigger difference than 10,000 others. The substitute for title count that is more valid to think about is the percentage of our subs that are streaming. The way that increases is by adding more content, more platforms, better user interface, all of those coming together. Of course that metric moved up from 41% a quarter ago to 48% this quarter. So we are really thrilled with the progress of that and we are going to continue to push content in. So think of it as we put in content and get streaming content as we get the user interface better and the platforms all of those drive that up. We are trying to back off of title count as a significant metric.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Regarding the outlook for content acquisition are the discussions with Showtime, HBO or Epics for their content?\nReed Hastings: I guess the question is are there discussions ongoing and we have discussions with everybody so a very broad range. That doesn’t imply that there is anything close on that. It is just an ongoing set of conversations with a wide range of networks and studios.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Imran Khan – JPMorgan.\nImran Khan: You bought back 7.4 million shares last year. Do you have any optimal number in your mind going forward?\nReed Hastings: Sorry, I am trying to think of how I want to answer that. We are going to be active as far as the stock this quarter and I anticipate we will continue to purchase shares throughout the year. Have in mind, we as a management team and our board think about using cash like we would any other productive asset. There is some minimum amount of cash we want to keep on the balance sheet and then we want to smartly deploy all the rest of it. If we can’t deploy it in the business then we will deploy it to repurchase shares provided that the share price at which we would repurchase makes sense from an IRR perspective. Now if you were optimistic about our ability to grow the size of the market, the subscriber base and future profits you probably have some pretty aggressive price expectations for the stock and if you don’t you probably don’t. Obviously we are pretty bullish on our ability to continue to grow subscribers, revenue, profit and free cash flow. So some pretty aggressive price points at which we are willing to acquire.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley.\nScott Devitt: To what extent do you believe the ability to update ones queue via iFlix, Flixster and most CE partner interfaces have or will change Netflix website traffic patterns as measured by third-party services?\nReed Hastings: That is a nice oblique way to ask the comp store question. That is a credit to you. I am not sure how much. We will get more and more viewing from devices. Not that much queue additions per se from devices but certainly your point is right which is if someone is only measuring web interaction for Netflix they are going to miss more and more of the picture over time. That may contribute to a difficulty for web measurement firms in terms of measuring Netflix accurately.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler – BoA/Merrill Lynch.\nNat Schindler: What was the cause of the large quarter-over-quarter step up in CapEx and what are your  expectations for capital expenditures in 2010?\nBarry McCarthy: Let me take the 2010 question first. I think that would be roughly flat. They were flat 2008 to 2009 and 2009 to 2010. I think they will be flat in 2010 and vary deal on how successful we are or not pushing IT infrastructure into the cloud. The answer with respect to Q4 is we as I said were busy investing in route of return information for our Op Centers, our hubs, and that was the largest single CapEx expenditure in the quarter.\nNat Schindler: What do you expect for the quarterly interest expense going forward?\nBarry McCarthy: Well the interest expense is fixed and the yield on the bonds was 8-8.5 and we sold them at par.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney – Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: First, what kind of response if any have you sensed from your subscriber base with regard to the 28 day sales window? Any complaints?\nReed Hastings: No material complaints. Again, subscribers are just not that aware of when DVDs come out relative to theatrical. The first title that is so affected is the Invention of Lying which is just hitting. So we really even if there were complaints they wouldn’t come up yet. From everything we have done before deciding to do this and seeing the results afterwards we are very happy with the decision.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me just chime in and say that we have frequently spoken about the rental mix of new release versus catalog and in the most recent quarter I think catalog was 73% so the new release was 27%. Some people have speculated that is not a true measure of demand on the subscriber base and that if we released key demand by street date we would see an entirely different picture. In fact we see exactly the same picture. Key demand for new release in December was 27% which was the average disc shipment in the quarter. So you might not imagine that somehow we are frustrating demand and that is the reason that we primarily ship by catalog. There is no data to support that conclusion.\nMark Mahaney: Currently what is the biggest obstacle to getting more streaming content?\nReed Hastings: Money.\nMark Mahaney: What caused the bump up in free subscribers in the quarter?\nReed Hastings: Typically each Q4, Q4 more than our other quarters is back loaded so there are more subscribers in their two week free trial at the end of the quarter. So that is a timing thing that is true each Q4.\nBarry McCarthy: I will comment that the year-over-year accelerating growth you will see a shift towards free.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of  Sandeep Aggarwal – Collins Stewart.\nSandeep Aggarwal: As we get more subscribers signing up because of streaming can we see churn going down even further?\nReed Hastings: Certainly it is possible that as consumers use the streaming more and more they end up having a more consistent relationship with Netflix rather than say turning it off in the summer and coming back in the fall. But it is also possible it is the other way that we get a broader demographic of subscribers that come in and they are very comfortable going out for a few months, going on, going out. So I would advise you to try to really focus on the net additions in the growth rather than the SAC and churn. That combination isn’t the most material part of the business. It is really the net additions that I focus on.\nSandeep Aggarwal: By when can you have streaming titles more than 35% of total titles you carry?\nReed Hastings: If we had chosen to we could have had that years ago because we would have taken the 35 smallest titles, such and such yoga, studio blah and had it. So again, title count can be super misleading. What you really want to ask is when are we going to have 2/3 of our subscribers streaming. When is the content so good that 2/3 of our subscribers choose to stream and the answer to that question for you, I would guess about 1.5 years just based on current trends of what we have seen growing.\nBarry McCarthy: I would think you also…I have heard you observe in the past that it is not just about content. It is also about platforms. So it is about building the ecosystem around streaming and we have made a tremendous amount of progress in 2009 and we will continue to in 2010 with respect to platform growth and so that makes a larger investment in content economical.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth – Barclays.\nDoug Anmuth: Q4 content acquisition was the highest it has been in two years. Should we think about that as a one-time step up related to the new Warner deal or is that more of a run rate going forward?\nReed Hastings: More of the latter than the former. It had a lot to do with moving out of rev share in Q4 and back into rev share in Q1 and timing of payables coming out of Q3.\nDoug Anmuth: Curious to know why there is no on-screen presence for the Wii. I assume this is for contractual reasons with Sony?\nReed Hastings: He probably means with Nintendo. Yes, that is just reference on the way for systems to operate like any other game and we will go off and market the service as an incredible internet video streaming on the Wii.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Michael Olson – Piper Jaffray.\nMichael Olson: Also with regards to the Wii, Wii is certainly a larger installed base than the other consoles but how do you feel about the Wii demographic versus the Xbox and PS3?\nReed Hastings: You know we will know a lot more after we launch but I think it is certainly true the PS3 and Xbox because they are more expensive, higher end boxes that do Hi Def are more video intensity so the question is the Wii installed base is significantly larger, and how do those wash out against each other? We look at all three as just great opportunities for us and we are continuing to push forward on all three.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank.\nJeetil Patel: What do the demographics of the new customers added in the past year look like relative to the existing subscriber base?\nReed Hastings: I don’t think we know of any very big change in the demographics. It is people who love movies and TV episodes and that is pretty broad. We are getting the benefit of that.\nJeetil Patel: Do your newer customers have any different propensities? In other words, higher streaming usage, lower or higher churn, two DVD rental plan, lower utilization?\nReed Hastings: I would say over the last three years we have continued to gain confidence there is great competitive [notes] in commercial value and profits in our lower price plans. So if you look at us four years ago we were only the $17 and $18 three out. We got into the $9 one out and we expanded and we continued to do that driving low prices, large subscriber base and substantial profits because it is frankly a more defensible way to hold onto those profits. So continuing with that trend more and more new subscribers are taking the $8.99 hybrid, rent all the DVDs you want one at a time and all the streaming you want. You see that reflected in ARPU. Again, we see that as a competitive strength which is we can make money at these price points and that is hard for anyone else to attack us and be able to do the same thing. So it is a scale advantage we are investing in.\nBarry McCarthy: You see that advantage translate in terms of profit in the gross profit per average paying customer. I think…I am doing this from memory, $4.96 in the quarter. You have to look back two years before you find profit per sub number that is actually higher. So notwithstanding the lower price points and the investment in streaming the profit dynamics of the model, the scale advantages that Reed just talked about are clearly present.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer \u0026 Company.\nJason Helfstein: Have you started to started to negotiate with studios for international streaming rights? If so, how are prices for streaming likely to compare to US prices?\nReed Hastings: It is unclear how the pricing will work out on something we are still experimenting in and looking at. We will be able to talk more about international in the second half of the year.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Mark Harding – Maxim Group.\nMark Harding: Does full-year 2010 subscriber guidance include expectations from an international launch? If so can you provide any color about a likely country service offering or pricing?\nReed Hastings: The narrow question from a modeling perspective is yes. But it is really small.\nBarry McCarthy: We don’t plan on giving any more information about what country, what price plans, what timing until we launch in the second half of the year.\nReed Hastings: We are doing that for competitive reasons, not to be difficult.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tony Wible – Janney Montgomery Scott.\nTony Wible: How do you balance the need for cash for digital rights and repurchases? What is your willingness to increase leverage?\nReed Hastings: The first priority is to improve the service because that part of the cycle drives all kinds of good things; subscriber growth, revenue, profit and free cash flow. After that if there is surplus cash we think about repurchasing the stock. We are growing free cash flow by in round numbers sort of one-third each year. So we have ample opportunity over time to go back to the capital markets for more debt and maintain the same amount of leverage in the business and the business grows and streaming…I don’t want to say the streaming service, as the hybrid service becomes more mature and as we acquire more content and as we gain more scale and the business becomes more predictable then we might think more aggressively about slightly increasing the amount of leverage on the business. So we are at 1.3 times when we close the transaction. Is 2 conceivable? Possibly but I don’t foresee a capital markets transaction in the foreseeable future.\nBarry McCarthy: Your question implies some tension between digital content acquisition and repurchase which doesn’t exist. The digital content is not free cash advance oriented. So we are P\u0026L constrained in terms of generating profit as opposed to cash constrained on the digital content.\nTony Wible: Was the sale of Roku recorded as a gain this quarter?\nReed Hastings: It was recorded as a gain. You can see it in the statement of cash flows and you have seen it in our SEC disclosures. The investment was carried at $5.7 million. We booked a gain pre-tax of about $1.7 million. After tax that translates to $1,035,000 on an EPS basis it equates to just around $0.02.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Heath Terry – FBR Capital Market.\nHeath Terry: Are there any reasons, legal, technological, etc. that you couldn’t develop a streaming application for the iPod? Would your current streaming service work on the device?\nReed Hastings: We haven’t yet done or submitted an iPhone application. We are optimistic that post the Google Voice brouhaha it would be approved. There is really no way of knowing in advance what Apple’s stance would be on that. Of course that application if it works on the iPhone it would work on the iPad. It is not a huge priority for us because we are so focused on the larger screen. Until we get our TV ubiquity and our Blue-ray ubiquity and we are getting close on video game ubiquity we would next turn to the small screen. It is just not a primary movie watching. It is something we will get around to but it is not in the near-term.\nHeath Terry: How many of your studio relationships come up for renewal this year?\nReed Hastings: Think of it as there is a ton, over 50 varied content deals. So it is not one per studio. It is hundreds of content deals. So they are individual sets of content that are negotiated and priced with varying durations and of course we are careful to make sure they are fairly distributed and staggered in their expirations so that we can manage it to a fairly steady flow of content coming in and us buying more and more content.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Jim Friedland – Cowen and Company.\nJim Friedland: The rate of decline in ARPU has slowed over the past four quarters. Is it reasonable to assume that as the streaming catalog and watch instantly usage grows ARPU will trend towards $8.99 or will you introduce multiple pricing tiers for different usage levels of streaming content?\nReed Hastings: The thing to think about is the Blue-ray so we are a little over 10% with Blue-ray and that is a $2 supplement. There is the trend towards the $8.99 but for those subs that want Blue-ray it is $2 more so $10.99 and that gives a little softening effect on the ARPU decline.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett – Lazard Capital Markets.\nBarton Crockett: With regards to paid TV rights, will Netflix seek to bid against paid TV networks such as Starz for exclusive rights to new movies in the pay TV window?\nReed Hastings: At this point we are looking to try to work with the existing pay TV services; Epic, Starz, HBO and Showtime and to be a distributor so we are writing them big checks partially because that includes all of their amazing original content. That is our primary strategy at this point.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of  John Blackledge – Credit Suisse.\nJohn Blackledge: After console deals where does growth come from in 2011 and beyond?\nReed Hastings: That is a great question that we ask ourselves too which is the incredible accelerating growth we have seen in the past three years is it mostly linked to the expansion first of streaming on laptops and then to the devices that have large installed bases. Frankly we are just not sure. That is one thesis. The other thesis is we are on the beginning of the streaming adoption S-curve and we will continue to grow into the installed bases. That is all of our subscribers have laptops to watch movies on and many of them have internet enabled Blue-ray players so we may be able to string that together. We will know more in the second half of this year as to the shape of those curves but even in the more conservative case in the midpoint of our guidance for the year we are looking at about 30% subscriber growth annually which is phenomenal.\nBarry McCarthy: To supplement Reed’s response, he made I think the most important point. A minor point links back to an earlier observation which is that WiFi is becoming ubiquitously available in TV sets so game platforms and other devices are sort of Gen One of the technology as it evolves into sort of a more general purpose device accessible by anyone and any competitive service but also accessible by Netflix. So with every television set purchased in the United States in 2011 can connect to the Internet they could all be Netflix subscribers.\nReed Hastings: That is a great point. In the optimistic case we will ride the broadband to the TV market which will grow hugely year after year after year for the next 10 plus years.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney – Citigroup.\nMark Mahaney: With regard to household penetration can you give us the updated numbers for Q4 for San Francisco Bay area and the rest of the country?\nReed Hastings: Bay area in Q4 was 22.6% up from 21.2% and the rest of the country was 10.8% in Q4 up from 9.6% in Q3.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler – BoA/Merrill Lynch.\nNat Schindler: Long term can you sustain unlimited streaming with an $8.99 price point?\nReed Hastings: We are not sure. It depends on how many subscribers want to have because the content is mostly fixed cost to produce and divide. Certainly if you had enough subscribers you could make the content holders very happy by writing them large checks and still have a big profit. So it is all a scale opportunity and we are focused on trying to be the largest scale of this internet, commercial free subscription services.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of George Askew – Stifel Nicolaus.\nGeorge Askew: You state that 48% of subscribers use streaming content in the fourth quarter. What is the percentage if you look only at subscribers added in 2009 or in the last few quarters?\nReed Hastings: We don’t have separate breakouts for each of the cohorts, at least not that we are doing for public disclosure. It is certainly true that newer subscribers that are introduced to streaming right in the beginning as part of their Netflix service are using Netflix at slightly higher rates than someone who has been a DVD subscriber for us for six years and in their heads we are a DVD service. That will change over time and those cohorts will come together.\nGeorge Askew: With regards to the Wii advertising what is the nature of the advertising online as opposed to offline and what might be the range of your spend?\nReed Hastings: The spend is included in our marketing plans. I don’t have a break down for you of the type of advertising. We will do what we view as most effective.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Guy-Charles Valois – Galliant Capital.\nGuy-Charles Valois: Would you expect operating margin to be higher or lower than current levels on a 100% streaming business model?\nReed Hastings: I think the long-term operating margins will be determined more by the amount of competition. If there is 3-4 fairly equal players in a large market you would expect the operating margins to be lower. If there is 1-2 you would expect the operating margins to be higher. So the actual streaming costs are quite low. The content costs, there are no hard costs it is just what we pay for it. Again, I think the way to think about it is what will be the likely competitive structure of the future market and from that you can get a model of what the long-term operating margins would be.\nBarry McCarthy: Along the way for a number of reasons [inaudible] a market share gain and driving hard for growth. We could in the alternative pursue a skimming strategy and take operating margins up. It is a conscious decision to do the former and not the latter.\nReed Hastings: To deepen our competitive modes with large scale, low prices.\nDeborah Crawford: The next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald – UBS.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Any color or numbers you can share with us on the average number of Netflix streaming devices in the household? How has that penetration been trending?\nReed Hastings: The average number of laptops in a house in America is probably 1.5. I am just making up numbers. I don’t really know. You have ever laptop you have the Roku, the video game consoles. I guess I don’t have any value to add in that answer.\nBrian Fitzgerald: A related question, are you seeing any substitution within the household from one device, say a Sony TV, over another, an Xbox or a TiVo?\nReed Hastings: No, our main focus is on streaming per se and it doesn’t really matter to us if it is streaming to a laptop, streaming to a laptop plugged into a TV, streaming to a Blue-ray to a TV, streaming directly to a TV. That is all a great consumer experience so we are just trying to make all of those experiences better and better.\nDeborah Crawford: Operator that was the last question that I have.\nReed Hastings: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. Q4 was a record setting quarter and it capped off a great year in which we saw accelerating subscriber growth powered by streaming. We expect the growth to continue which you will see reflected in our guidance and I look forward to reporting on our progress with you on our next quarter’s call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you all for joining us. Have a great afternoon.

With that I’ll hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2009 ended in extraordinary fashion. We reported revenue for the year of $3.4 billion and a GAAP loss of $0.05 per share. The environment is clearly difficult and uncertain so our first priority is to set an operating expense level that balances cash conservation while allowing us to continue to invest in initiatives that are of great importance to the market and in which we lead the industry. We have initiatives in all areas to reduce operating expenses. Our stretch goal is to reduce operating expense by $35 million from the current level of $300 million per quarter by the end of Q2. Although fiscal 2009 was extremely difficult, it was also one of our best years for innovation. We made important advances in many areas. In graphics processing, after a stumble in Q2 we have regained our performance leadership position with the GeForce GTX 295, GTX 285 and GTX 260. We introduced PhysX, the industry’s first GPU accelerated physics processing. Major studios including Electronic Arts, THQ and Take 2 have standardized on PhysX. DriverHeaven noted that “there are real visual benefits to be had from enabling PhysX in games such as Mirror’s Edge.” Bit-tech said that “the PhysX content enhances the gaming experience, giving a tangible benefit to being a video card owner.” Gamers have been stunned by our 3-D vision, full HD stereoscopic solution. Three-D vision is the first ever high resolution, stereo 3-D solution for the home. Bjorn3d said that “once you have it, you will never give it up.” PC Magazine described it as “a mind blowing innovation.” In Q4 we recaptured market share in the performance segment. We intend to continue share gains by offering the highest performance products while differentiating with our advantages in PhysX, CUDA and 3-D Vision. We shipped Tesla for revenues this year and officially started the era of GPU computing, where our CUDA parallel processing architecture can accelerate computive intensive applications by 100 times over a CPU alone. CUDA has well over 25,000 developers around the world. With CUDA we’re able to speed up general purpose computer intensive applications like we do for 3-D graphics processing. Developers are finding major speed ups for algorithms ranging from nano-molecular dynamics to image processing; medical image reconstruction; and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis. Over 100 universities around the world including the MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the National Taiwan University now teach parallel computing with CUDA. ASoos, Bull, Cray, Dell, HP and Lenovo now offer high performance computing solutions with Tesla. There are now over 1,000 customers around the world including Motorola, Chevron, GE Healthcare and even General Mills the consumer products company. Tesla has become the first GPU used in super computing and now powers Japan’s Tsubame, the 29th fastest supercomputer in the world. And Wipro Technologies responding to market demand now offers CUDA programming services. Aside from the thousands of researchers who have used CUDA to accelerate their time to discovery, popular off the shelf software packages such as ANSYS, LANView and Mathematica are now CUDA accelerated. Symcor sells check scanners that use CUDA for image recognition to detect fraud. Scicomp uses CUDA in their derivatives pricing software. And medical equipment is now available from Technic Scan that uses CUDA to enhance early detection of breast cancer, reducing the analysis from a three hour process to just 16 minutes, making single visit diagnosis possible for the first time. We launched the Tesla personal supercomputer and enabled a four Teraflop supercomputer at the price of a typical workstation. We estimate 15 million scientists and engineers worldwide can benefit from this breakthrough. HPC, High Performance Computing wire described it as “the biggest news of the supercomputing ’08 show.” Cray with the CX-1 was the first to ship a Tesla personal supercomputer. One of our major initiatives last year was to capture a significant position in mobile computing by introducing innovative and market defining products. Notebook is the fastest growing segment of the PC market and one that we can offer a great deal of value. Through low power architecture and innovation, our GPU’s can simultaneously increase notebook performance while extending battery life. We announced Ion, a high performance GPU that also incorporates all system networking and IO functions into a single chip. Steve Jobst called it “an incredible chip.” Ion is at the core of every MAC book from the air to the pro. The Ion platform is now shipping or will be soon from virtually every major PC OEM. At CS we launched Ion for Intel’s Atom CPU. Even coupled with the smallest X86 CPU in the world, the performance is astounding. TechGage described the Ion PC as “a potent little computer with almost limitless possibilities” and gave it a Best of CES Award. It was also awarded the Best Enabling Technology by Laptop Magazine. And Computer Reseller News described it as “one of the top ten biggest chip stories of 2008.” We also made great progress with Tegra, our ultra low power mobile computing processor. Tegra is a single chip mobile computer that delivers a full Internet experience while consuming 1/20th the power of even the lowest power [X-80] PC’s. Tegra enables a new class of mobile Internet computing devices that allow for many days of use as opposed to the several hours of battery life for a notebook PC. Tegra has been designed into personal media players; personal navigation devices; smart phones and mobile Internet computers and we’ll see revenue ramping in the second half of this year. We had three major strategic objectives this year; lead the industry in graphics processing, revolutionize computing with CUDA and Tesla, and establish NVIDIA as a low power innovator by creating breakthrough products for mobile computing. I am pleased with the excellent achievements we made in each of these important areas. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results. I will return in a moment to talk of our future opportunities.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks Jen-Hsun. My comments today will cover both the full year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 that ended January 25, 2009, including comments on both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included in our press release and on our website. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $481.1 million which is down 46% from Q3 and is down 60% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $3.4 billion which is down from the prior year by 16%. The weakness in demand for the fourth quarter was across the board. Compared to Q3 the GPU business was down 47%; the Professional Services business was down 44%; and the NCP business was down 51%. There were no safe havens. Within the GPU business desktop was down 34% as we believe we regained some market share particularly in the high end, but the overall high end market was very soft. Notebook was down 63%, reflecting the buying trend toward low end systems with integrated graphics. Memory was down to $7.2 million for the quarter from $22.3 million the prior quarter. All of this was in the environment of the channel depleting inventory. Therefore, our sell-in was less than the channels sell-out. We believe current channel inventory is only slightly more than one month, down from almost three months last quarter. ASP’s across the board were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, so the decline in revenue was primarily a reflection of the decline in unit volume. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.4% on a GAAP basis. Included in the GAAP results were several items worth mentioning. For the quarter, we took new inventory reserves of slightly more than $50 million. Normally we take reserves of $5 to $10 million. These additional reserves reflect the reduced demand in the marketplace. These additional reserves cost us almost ten percentage points in gross margin for the quarter. Without these reserves, gross margin still would have declined quarter-to-quarter but more in line with the market movement toward the low end SKUs. Also included in the GAAP results is a small initial insurance reimbursement for the weak, Die/Packaging material set warranty issue that we recognized in Q2. Since our estimate for the cost of this warranty issue is unchanged, most of the insurance proceeds were recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold for GAAP purposes. Stock-based compensation allocated to cost of goods sold was approximately $2 million for the quarter. Operating expenses included a non-recurring charge of $18.9 million associated with the termination of a development contract related to a new campus construction project that we have put on hold. Without this charge, operating expenses would have been below our guidance. As Jen-Hsun said we have initiated many cost reduction efforts and even in Q4 some of them began to take effect. Without stock-based compensation and the non-recurring charge, operating expenses were down from the third quarter. Headcount for the quarter and the year ended at 5,420 which is up 127 from the third quarter and up 435 for the year. We essentially have a hiring freeze in place with only the most critical positions being filled. The tax rate for the quarter was a credit of 13.3% and for the year it was a credit of 30%. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $147.7 million and non-GAAP was a loss of $94.4 million. GAAP net loss for the year was $30 million and for non-GAAP it was a net income of $303 million. On the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $1.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This is down approximately $49 million from the prior quarter. Operating activities in the quarter used only about $20 million in cash which reflects good asset management in light of the significant decline in revenue. Accounts receivable declined by $289 million quarter-to-quarter reflecting the comparable revenue decline. The days sales outstanding declined slightly quarter-to-quarter and so far receivables appear to be in good shape. Inventories grew by $14 million quarter-to-quarter even after the additional inventory reserves. Obviously the significant decline in revenue left us with a lot of inventory. We believe the inventory is good. There’s just a lot of it. As a result we have significantly reduced our manufacturing demands. We expect to deplete significant amounts of inventory going forward. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $50 million, flat with Q3. And capital expenditures were $43 million, down from $109 million last quarter. We have a focus on reducing capital expenditures and want them to be less than depreciation and amortization on a quarterly basis. Accounts payable declined by $168 million as we scaled back production levels. As for an outlook, in this environment it’s almost impossible to give a reasonable and competent forecast. We were very wrong last quarter. In retrospect, October was the last decent month and unfortunately it was not in our quarter. But based on the fact that sell-out for the channel exceeded our sell-in and the very low inventory levels in the channel, we do not see further declines in revenue. Today we can’t say confidently when and by how much revenue will increase. We can only say that we currently don’t see further declines and our outlook is for flat to slightly up revenue for the first quarter. As for gross margins, we currently do not expect significant inventory write-offs in Q1 and margins should return to the mid-30’s. The one thing we can control is our operating expenses and as Jen-Hsun said we’re instituting many actions to contain and reduce OpEx. Normally in Q1 operating expenses would be up $15 million or more from Q4, merely because of the FICA we have to pay in the beginning of the year and the reduced amount of time off that employees take in Q1 relative to Q4. Because of the actions we have already taken and further actions that we are implementing, we believe OpEx for the first quarter will be flat to slightly down from the Q4 level. And that these actions will lead to further reductions in Q2 and Q3. With that I’ll turn it back over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Marv. The GPU is the new soul of the PC. In high performance computing our GPU’s are accelerating time to discovery, in many cases 100 times. It would take [Morris Long] nearly ten years to improve the performance of a computer 100 times. This speed up is truly revolutionary. For gamers our GPU not only renders a beautiful and immersive world but with PhysX we also simulate the physical properties of the world to bring more dynamics and realism. We are delighting visual content creators around the world as our CUDA GPU’s make it possible for them to manipulate high resolution images with great ease and reduce video editing process from hours to minutes. And for mobile computers, our GPU brings a level of performance that is surprising while enhancing battery life at the same time. Whether for gamers or digital artists or researchers, and from workstations to supercomputers to game PC’s to notebook PC’s, the GPU is making the critical difference. The GPU is the new soul of the PC. The word is spreading fast. Wired Magazine recently wrote, “Like a wise-cracking sidekick who winds up stealing the movie from a too bland lead actor, Graphics Processing Units are edging more general purpose, central processing units out of the limelight.” USA Today wrote, “[Separate] graphics chips sometimes called discrete graphics can vastly improve a PC’s performance by crunching images separately instead of relying on the main processor to do it.” And CNET News said, “When you start looking at a PC today the central processor means less and less. The GPU is simply becoming a better way for PC makers to differentiate.” As the inventor of the GPU, our objective this year is to continue to expand the use and proliferate the adoption of GPU’s. From notebook PC’s to net books to supercomputing workstations to servers, we have great opportunities ahead to grow our business. We are in a position to take share with GeForce as we continue to highlight our advantages with CUDA, PhysX and 3D Vision. Tesla is now shipping and interest around the world continues to build. We will ship Tegra this year. Both Tesla and Tegra take us into new growth markets and will increase our [tamp]. And with Ion we are going to revolutionize the small and affordable notebook PC market, giving us growth into the fastest growing PC segment. During the year we also have operational challenges we must address. To get gross margins improving again, we must tackle our inventory management. This is one of our top priorities and we will surely address it. We will also be highly discriminating on spending, so as to conserve cash flow allowing us to continue to invest and realizing our vision for the era of the GPU. These are surely challenging times but we are also more excited than ever about the prospects of the GPU and the importance of our work. We are delighted to take questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities.\nPatrick Wang: First off can you help us understand what makes you feel confident about the – about your revenue guidance and that you’re not looking for a sequential decline in the upcoming quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I guess I’ll comment and I’ll let Marv comment. You know we track sell-outs rigorously in the marketplace and you’ve now heard this from nearly every computer company in the world or in just about every electronics company in the world that for whatever reason October was a reasonable month, but November fell off a cliff. November was the beginning of our quarter and so we experienced three consecutive difficult months. As we monitored our sell-outs we saw that very effect, that the end markets just got weaker starting in November. And since then it has more or less flattened out if not slightly increased a bit. And because we know what we’re selling into our customers and because we know what they’re selling out, we have a pretty good sense that inventory levels are depleting very quickly. And so that’s how we get a sense of where we are in the business and we believe we’ve hit a trough. But the important thing is that we don’t know what we don’t know. And there’s a lot of people in the world who don’t know what they don’t know right now. And I don’t think we stand alone here. But that’s our best estimate of our business and therefore best guidance that we can offer you.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, I would emphasize exactly what Jen-Hsun said. The sell-out while it is weak was definitely not as weak as our revenue in the quarter. So the depletion of inventory in the channel, coupled with the fact that we did not have a decent – October was not in our quarter, says that unless demand continues to fall significantly from here that our prospects are better than they were last quarter.\nPatrick Wang: And then as a follow-up, just given the fact that we were hearing chatter about new SKU’s coming from you guys and your competitors or your friends over there in Santa Clara there – in Sunnyvale, any sense of a pricing war? Anything in terms of competitive pricing or advantages here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don’t think either company is holding any punches at the moment and so I’m not expecting the competitive position to be more competitive than now. There are plenty of opportunities for us to be competitive with each other. It’s a very competitive market. And there are always new SKU’s coming out. You know they have new products and we have new products. We’re not in the business of announcing future products. We have quite a strong position right now in the performance segment again. And so we have no reason to announce future products. The competition is obviously different so they’re talking about future prospects all the time right now. It just serves to freeze their market. And so I think that announcing the next generation product long before it gets shipped is not a smart thing to do right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research.\nDaniel Ernst: On the downturn here, how much of the current revenue weakness is the overall market decline versus a down specing of machines in the market, where they’re either going to a lower spec GPU or you know settling with the integrated one? So demand for PC’s overall going down and the other is what they’re specing on that machine. And then related to that as we look across this economic downturn which none of us know how long it is, but the longer it is do we run a greater risk of the and we should for the mainstream part of the market the integrated graphics chip improving to the point where it’s good enough. So if the downturn is one or two years but in one or two years time the integrated sort of catches up to be good enough for the mainstream part of the market.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our ASP’s were generally flat this quarter. And so from that you could argue that people are not buying down per se. There is a very significant factor that is happening in the notebook segment however. There’s the surge of the net book market and you could characterize the net book market as low end. And if I were to just for the sake of my description right now describe the market as high, mid and low our participation in the notebook market has been by and large about the upper half of mid and most of high. And we have no participation historically in the lower part of mid and the low end market. All of a sudden the Atom processor has driven a dramatic surge of net book PC’s. Some people call it a net book PC but the fact of the matter is they’re inexpensive PC’s. And during difficult times many people who still need to have a PC or would like to have a PC now has a very inexpensive version to buy. And so the demand for Atom PC’s and these net books if you will has really really surged. I think what’s going to happen is that the low end part of the marketplace is going to cannibalize the mid-range part of the market. And people who want performance still will go for performance. The net book will hardly serve their needs. But for a lot of people in the mid-range part of the marketplace the net book is clearly, clearly going to disrupt that. And so our strategy is Ion. We announced Ion for the Atom processor at ZS. And the reception has been extraordinary. And the reason for that is because Atom with the Ion processor creates a full feature notebook. It’s fully capable of DX 10, 3D graphics, high definition video, Blu-ray Disc, just about anything you want to do on your computer is possible with the Atom processor and an Ion. And so this platform I think is a wonderful growth opportunity for us because it’s the first time that we’ve really been able to enter into the lower end segment of the marketplace. But I think  you’re – what you’re thinking about the future of the PC industry certainly is true. I think that’s what’s likely to happen, that the high end marketplace will continue to be what it is as people who want more performance can get it. There’s a lot of different reasons to bring performance to the high end. But the mid-range part of the marketplace could very well become an extremely large low-end part of the marketplace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.\nJoanne Feeney: I just was hoping to get a little bit of clarity about how you guys were thinking about the current environment, what you’re assuming when you draw that conclusion about hopefully flat or slightly up. So would we have to think that you’re assuming that end market demand is going to be flat to slightly up or that the channel might be rebuilding inventory this quarter and that’s what’s going to pull up your revenues?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, Joanne, if you just assume that the market didn’t get any better our revenue has to go up because remember they depleted significant channel inventory last quarter.\nJoanne Feeney: Can you give us a sense of how much that went down in your estimation, Marv?\nMarvin D. Burkett: You’re talking about the inventory?\nJoanne Feeney: Yes.\nMarvin D. Burkett: I think that they went from two-and-a-half to three months worth of inventory down to between one and one-and-a-half months of inventory.\nJoanne Feeney: And then within your inventory in house, can you give us a sense of how much of that inventory – what share is the older 65 nanometer product and what’s the newer stuff?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, we have more 65 nanometer parts than I thought we were going to have. But that’s because the revenue was less than we thought. But I would still say the majority of the product by far is 55 nanometer. So we’re going through the 65. It’s more than I would like to have but it’s not an intolerable amount.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.\nTim Luke: A couple of quick things, Marv, just starting off on inventory your inventory’s now like at 140 days on hand. Where do you think that goes directionally in the April quarter and what are you trying to target? I would assume where you’ve had success with moving the channel lower the inventory’s showing somewhat higher in terms of just the revenue balance. Separately I was just wondering if you could just lay out for us some of the factors that you think may help the gross margin. I think you’re saying 35 or mid-30’s going forward for April. How do you see that going forward? And then lastly, if I may, in planning your OpEx which you’re lowering by $35 million, how are you thinking about the revenue? Obviously you’re not at breakeven yet. How are you thinking about the revenue shape for the back half of the year? And maybe that’s more of a Jen-Hsun question. Or are you just suggesting that you’ve got to invest irrespective of when you see the revenue come back. And where is that revenue? Is it mostly in the new products or how do you see desktop for example? Thank you.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, let me take the inventory issue first. We have significantly cut back our [wafer] starts. I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone. When you have this inventory level we don’t need a lot more wafers. So based on the inventory that we have, if you look into Q1 I see a significant inventory reduction coming. I can’t give you the magnitude of that until you give me the revenue number. But I would say something significantly reduced in Q1. Going forward this inventory should last us into the Q2 and Q3 before we have to replenish at those levels. So I think that our production buys are going to remain at a low level all the way through Q1 and it’s going to take something into Q2 and Q3 with some other products and a slightly better market before we have to reinstitute wafer buys. The last question that you have with regard to the OpEx is that I go back to the goal that Jen-Hsun has established, of getting revenue down by $35 million on a quarterly basis as what we can do without jeopardizing future revenue. It is not based on us being able to breakeven at some revenue level. It’s on the basis of what we think we can do without jeopardizing the future. Now at $500 million even if you cut it by $35 million we would not breakeven. So the issue is when does revenue start to recover and how successful are we in bringing the OpEx down by the $35 million.\nTim Luke: And also presumably where do you think the gross is? Presumably you’re not spending a lot in the desktop GPU space or are you in terms of investment and OpEx? Is the spending mostly on the new products?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, in the second half of the year we have some areas of growth that we’re relatively confident about. And these are areas of new growth. Tegra, our mobile computing device – mobile computing processor will ship towards the second half of the year. And so we’re confident that will be revenue contributing and profit contributing. Tesla continues to ramp. We are engaged with more customers all the time who are looking for Tesla in their servers to dramatically accelerate their computing needs. So we’re expecting that to grow. We’re also expecting Ion to contribute greatly to our growth going forward. Ion is as we talked about both a really fabulous net – a notebook processor but also is terrific in the entry level part of the PC marketplace in companion with a very low cost microprocessor. And so we think that that could revolutionize the affordable PC market and so my sense is that we’re going to continue to see growth in the Ion business. So those are – I’m sorry?\nTim Luke: I was just wondering if Marv if separately you might be able to address the gross margin as [inaudible]?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, if you look at the gross margin from last quarter you would have what I would call a more normal inventory reserve position. That would have added eight to ten percentage points to margin. So all you have to do is not write off a lot of inventory and the margins return to the level that I outlined.\nTim Luke: For the nanometer could you confirm the timeline that you’re expecting for that transition? Thank you so much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have really fabulous products in the marketplace today and we don’t announce future products.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech.\nDoug Freedman: Marv can you go through the new product segment and give us an idea which ones are likely to be accretive to gross margins and which ones should you be more successful are actually going to be a headwind? And any comment that you guys can make about the gaming PC platforms would be helpful as well.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Accretive gross margins – which gross margin level are you talking about it being accretive to? The one for last quarter doesn’t take much.\nDoug Freedman: Good point.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, let’s take them somewhat in order. Tesla certainly is accretive gross margin. You know I think Tegra is certainly not a drag. I think it depends on what gross margin level that you’re talking about. It’s not a drag. If you’re talking about the Ion platform, it’s probably in the mid-30’s. So if we’re very successful there it’s not a huge improvement in the gross margin percentage but certainly a significant improvement in gross margin dollars. Does that help?\nDoug Freedman: And then can you talk about the gaming platforms and what’s happening in the gaming market space?\nJen-Hsun Huang: What is the gaming platforms?\nDoug Freedman: PS Sony, PS 3 and Royal [inaudible].\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don’t know what the question is. I mean they –\nMarvin D. Burkett: Do you want to know what the revenue was in the quarter or?\nDoug Freedman: Yes. Yes, the revenue or what your outlook is for that marketplace if that’s seeing the same type of conditions that you’ve seen in your market space.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. I think it – remember a significant portion of the I’ll call it the Sony Royalty portion is based on their unit production. And so as their unit productions drop, our revenue in that segment will drop. And I think that they’re projecting much lower production levels in Q1 than they had in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Suji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.\nSuji De Silva: On Ion can you guys talk about what you think the pace and quantity of the ramp here, just in terms of your share on the Intel platform particularly?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don’t know how to characterize it for you really aside from the fact that we have no booked projects happening all over the world. You know a lot of it just depends on the success of our customers and these platforms. So there’s still a lot of execution between now and then and lots of unknowns. So I’m reluctant to give you numbers that frankly I don’t know how to project. I do know that the design activity around our chip set is increasing and I do know that we’ve announced a really exciting product. So I think if and the markets are really resonating with it then I’m sure that if you follow this market you’ve heard just about nothing but about Ion these days and the excitement that people have to build net books and low-end notebooks with it. So I’m enthusiastic about the prospects and I look forward to reporting on in a couple of quarters.\nSuji De Silva: But Jen-Hsun then the timing would be back half loaded or steady throughout the year? Any comments there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are design wins that are being launched in just about every quarter. There’s some this quarter. There will be some the next quarter for sure. And hopefully they’ll be all fully ramped up for Q3, Q4.\nSuji De Silva: And switching to your guidance in terms of the flat revenues, how do you see that and the notebook market versus the desktop market given the different dynamics you cited for the current quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: We don’t see significant change in any of them. You know if they are relatively flat to slightly up there’s not a significant change in any of them. We don’t think that the flat is derived from any one particular segment.\nSuji De Silva: And then on the OpEx cuts were there any particular areas that were kind of overly hit by those or was it a broad-based effort on the part of the company to do more maybe with six people instead of seven people. Is that the spirit of it Jen-Hsun?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We affected a lot of different areas whether it’s the executives of our company took the largest and most significant affects. But many of our – almost all of our employees will make a contribution. There’s travel reductions; there’s just ideas all around the world and around the company to reduce spending wherever it can be reduced without affecting the key investments that I’ve highlighted. So it’s broad-based and it’s everywhere.\nSuji De Silva: What’s the pricing decline you’re assuming in your guidance versus what typical pricing would decline? Thanks.\nMarvin D. Burkett: No change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital.\nDavid Wu: Can you talk a little about the Marv on the breakeven either on a pro forma basis or on a cash basis? What kind of revenues are we looking at from a breakeven standpoint on a quarterly basis?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, that’s a very complex question David. You have to tell me where the revenue is, what the gross margins are, how successful we are in getting our OpEx down to that targeted level.\nDavid Wu: If we achieve the targeted level OpEx and if we have gross margin in the mid to sort of mid-30’s, what kind of cash breakeven – operating cash breakeven are we looking at or pro forma breakeven are we looking at?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, that’s an easy calculation for you to do. I’m not going to do it. If you have operating expenses at the $265 level, that includes some stock-based compensation which is non-cash; that includes some depreciation which is non-cash and so now you have a gross margin number on X dollars of revenue that’s an easy calculation to make.\nDavid Wu: What about if I were to look at say the revenue is $500 million is your first quarter roughly end demand number and the peak of last year was about – assuming that those are all end demand about $900 million whereabouts if you make the seasonal adjustment, where is end demand? If Q1 is $500 assuming normal seasonality, how high would that number be on your best quarter of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, David, and I don’t think I’m saying something that’s inconsistent with what you know, there’s nothing that we’re experiencing right now that is seasonal. We don’t mean to make light of it but the environment is very difficult and uncertain. It’s very difficult and uncertain not just for us but it’s very difficult and uncertain for everybody. And so our strategy is to make sure that we eliminate and as be as discriminating as we can on spending, but continue to invest in the things that we know are important to the marketplace and things that we’re world class at doing, and continue to innovate and challenge our employees to build amazing things.\nDavid Wu: Talking about innovation there has been a number – I guess the next round of game console design wins are coming up or rumor has been awarded to different people. How close are we actually in terms of competing for the next generation of PS4 or Xbox or Wii?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It makes no sense to comment on rumors. And it also would be terrible to comment on future products of our customers. It is not our job to do that. And so it’s just – they’re just rumors, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan.\nShawn Webster: Would you characterize the one to one-and-a-half months of inventory as being normal or lean or still on the high end of normal?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Very lean.\nShawn Webster: So is your visibility now about the same or better than it was when you came into the January quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: How do you mean that, the January quarter? You mean our Q1?\nShawn Webster: Would you say that you’re setting the guidance at flattish or up slightly now, would you say that your visibility now was better than where it was when you came into Q4 or the same?\nMarvin D. Burkett: I don’t know how you characterize that because when we went into Q4 the market had not dropped off a cliff. So I should certainly hope that the visibility is better now than it was then.\nShawn Webster: Can you give us an update on some of your new products and what did Tesla represent for revenues for you in Q4 and Tegra and your outlook for calendar 2009?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let’s see, Tesla for Q4 did we break that out?\nMarvin D. Burkett: We haven’t broken it out in the past. It was up millions of dollars, several million dollars. I won’t characterize it beyond that. When it gets to be significant Shawn we’ll break it out. Tegra was insignificant.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Tegra hasn’t shipped yet. It’s really second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Uche Orji – UBS.\nUche Orji: First question to you Marv, if I look at the guidance you’re giving for the current quarter, how much – what should we expect for the workstation business within that guidance? And if you can just explain that in the context of what is a very challenging IT spending environment. I just want to be able to reconcile how much that will contribute across margin and just reconcile it with your guidance. So if you can talk about what that makes you see in the workstation business – what you saw the last quarter and what you are implying within the guidance of the current quarter that would be helpful.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Okay. Now the workstation business took a precipitous decline in last quarter Q4. It was down about 47%, Q3 to Q4. That was surprising. I mean if it was any business that would be somewhat of a safe haven from this you would have thought it was in the workstation area. Didn’t happen. So what the anticipation is relatively no change from the Q4 levels into Q1. So a continued weakness I would call it.\nUche Orji: And that is supported by what you have in the backlog currently or do you require turns business to make that flat revenue guidance? This is very important for your gross margin. That’s the reason why I’m pressing on this.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, we always require turns. We are not a business or our business model is not based on a significant backlog at the beginning of the quarter. Our whole business is based on significant turns within the quarter.\nUche Orji: If I look at the high-end GPU business, what is happening with pricing right now? Is pricing stabilized at this point because you know late last year [A\u0026D] did try to make a push in that market. And so what is the outlook for pricing in that market for the current quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: In Q2 of last year we did take a big step down in pricing. We improperly priced our products too high. But we corrected that almost right away. The pricing that we’re seeing out there is relatively stable at the moment. We’re gaining share and we have the best products and we stay focused and continue to do our work and highlight our unique advantages with CUDA and PhysX and 3D Vision. I’m confident we’ll continue to gain share.\nUche Orji: With Intel introducing some chipset product that allows them to [M\u0026P] you know I’m just trying to understand how you now position Ion because you know 3D gaming which is probably a key feature is not something that you’ve heard [inaudible] talk about as something consumers care about in a big way. So how are you going to position Ion against that [one view]?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know 720P is not Blu-ray compatible as you know. And 720P is the minimum requirement of high def and so high definition includes all the way to 1080P for one. The overall performance under Windows Vista and Vista Premium and the requirements for DX10 and Windows 7 coming out and you know all of the trans-coding and video editing and video processing capabilities of CUDA are available on the Ion platform. And so if you want the best possible experience while still being extremely affordable Ion is really the way to go.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Schneider - Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider: To follow up on the gross margin question a little bit, in the GPU space specifically desktop and notebooks can you talk about some of the pressure you might see from pricing and inventory reductions in the out quarters going into the second half versus whatever benefits you might get from 55 nanometer and lower cost reductions?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Wow. You know that’s difficult to say. I mean all of our production now is on 55 nanometer and you know later in the year would be even smaller geometries but how that impacts the gross margin is difficult to say. I think that the individual product gross margin in my view is not the issue. It’s the total volume. So I think we’ll do fine from a gross margin standpoint.\nJames Schneider: So would you expect the GPU margins to continue to recover into the back half after or early into Q2?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well I think the gross margins to the GPU business will recover in Q1. Remember a significant portion of the I’ll call it the increased inventory write-off we took in Q4 was in the GPU business. So there should be significant recovery in GPU gross margins in Q1.\nJames Schneider: But no sense about beyond Q1?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No.\nJames Schneider: And then just a follow-up I think Jen-Hsun you mentioned Ion in reference to the chipset product on notebook platforms as well as it’s paired with the Intel Atom processor. Could you talk about some of the design wins you’ve got specifically when paired with the Intel Atom please?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well we shouldn’t announce any design wins until the design wins ship. And so when it does ship I’d be more than delighted to address it. I can only tell you that there’s enthusiastic support and design activities all over the world and so we’ll see when they ship. When they do ship hopefully it’s not too long we’ll be delighted to talk about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glen Yeung – Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung: Marv I hear your point that you don’t want to impair your future growth by reducing OpEx to too low a level but one could argue that with sales down 60% year-on-year and you know with a pretty uncertain end market out there the future growth isn’t hurt anyway. So I guess when we think about your business going forward what would you need to see? I mean is there some lack of growth element out there that says, “Jeez, I’ve got to cut anyway because it’s just so bad.”\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, we’re always looking at things like that. That’s the job of management to look at them. You know if you were to tell me that the current economic environment is going to continue for the next ten years, then lots of people not only us but other companies are going to have to restructure their businesses. If you’re telling me that the economic environment will change very quickly that’s an early holding on till it comes back. So I don’t know how long this economic environment is going to take. But I do know the only way out of recessions and significant recessions like this is not by cutting your future. The way out of the recession is by investing in future revenues. So we want to continue to do that. As long as we’re not burning through significant cash, and as long as we’re investing in the right places, that’s more significant to me. So I don’t know what’s going to happen in the economic environment.\nJen-Hsun Huang: And the investments that we make, Glen, we want to make sure that we’ve scrutinized all  of our investments. And we’ve asked ourselves are we investing in areas that’s going to lead us to growth? And if it’s not going to lead us to growth there’s no point investing in it. And so we have to believe in what we believe. And once we believe it we’re going to stay committed to it. Obviously environments change and we’ll continue to reevaluate but based on what we see right now we’re making good decisions.\nGlen Yeung: I also wanted to ask about the linearity in the reported quarter and the implication that has for the start of the quarter because it sounds like November was really bad, I would guess that December was probably worse. Was January better? And at the beginning of February because of the flat guidance I’m just thinking about the pattern in the last quarter, it would sort of suggest February must have started off not that bad. And maybe if you could confirm or deny if that’s true.\nMarvin D. Burkett: November started off bad. December was worse and January wasn’t a lot better.\nGlen Yeung: Marv if I think about that going down from the first month to the third month, if you want to be flat don’t you have to be going up in the first month to the third month in this quarter? And doesn’t that seem like an unlikely situation?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, I don’t think so. You know, I think that you saw us being I’ll call it a victim of the quarter, our quarter being November, December, January. I think that was a negative compared to some of the other guys out there that are on a calendar quarter. I think that the depletion of the channel inventory was a negative for us relative to what’s happening in the marketplace. And those two factors alone tell me that they weren’t normal if you want to call it that or the run rate of consumption out there is equal to or better than our revenue for the last quarter.\nOperator: I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead sir.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our progress for Q1.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the call over to your host, Jeff Evanson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJeff Evanson: Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter financial results question-and-answer conference call. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla’s Chairman and CEO, and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer. We announced our financial results for the first quarter shortly after the close of trading today. The shareholder letter, financial results, and webcast of this Q\u0026A session are all available at our Investor Relations website at ir.teslamotors.com. Today's call is for your questions and we will conduct the Q\u0026A session live. (Operator Instructions) Like last quarter, we will limit this call to 45 minutes. During the course of this call, we may discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on management's current expectations. Actual results or events could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views as of today and should not be relied upon after today. We also disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. And now, Patrick, could we please have the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ben Schuman from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.\nBen Schuman: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the call and congratulations on the great delivery and results in the quarter.\nElon Musk: Thanks.\nBen Schuman: I guess my first question is around the ZEV credits, you disclose the amount of revenue in Q1, can you say how much is implied in the Q2 gross margin guidance and kind of its part of that what are some of the big gross margin drivers to get from that 5% level now, excluding the ZEV revenue to 25% and do you expect that 25% of those without whatever positive impact from the lease accounting that you might see?\nElon Musk: Okay. There is like few questions in there. Yeah, so we’re expecting a decline in the credit revenue for Q2 and then probably fairly significant decline in Q3 and as I said back right now, we’re not expecting anything in Q4. That’s our – I mean, it might be some ZEV credit revenue in Q4, but we’re not accounting on it. I don’t have – I can’t give anymore precision than that at this time. The …\nBen Schuman: Okay. So bigger the plant in Q3 than in Q2, is it fair to say that?\nElon Musk: Oh sure, of course yeah.\nBen Schuman: Okay and then just one more from me, the $200 million in CapEx, can you talk about as what that’s going to exactly may be how much of the gross margin improvement might be tied to additional capital expenditures?\nDeepak Ahuja: Ben, Deepak here. Clearly some of the CapEx is related to improvements we’re making in-house by bringing more equipment in and automating our processes, better results in gross margin improvement. And a portion of that is also new product development and then another portion is the infrastructure development of the service centers, our stores and the Supercharger network.\nElon Musk: Yeah. I think it's worth noting that in probably Q1, despite actually spending quite a lot of money on new service centers, expanding Supercharger network stores and other things that obviously we don't need to keep doing – that's something that's going to need to occur on an ongoing basis, but really test this out. We need to establish a service network and in particular the company.\nBen Schuman: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDan Galves: Thanks for taking my questions. First one again kind of regarding the gross margin, I did I think the same simple math that Ben did to get to somewhere in the 5% to 6% gross margin, automotive gross margin excluding the ZEV credits. If that's in the ballpark, it seems like you need to increase gross profit per unit by something in the $17,000 to $19,000 per unit by the end of the year. I was wondering if you could give us kind of the big buckets that you're targeting for that improvement, and how much is within your control and how much might be – you might need price concessions from your suppliers, if any?\nElon Musk: Sure. It's worth noting that when you see the gross margin for Q1, we're giving you obviously the gross margin average over the quarter. And so the gross margin at the end of Q1 was significantly better than at the beginning of Q1. So you may still think of we're starting from a base of 5% or 6%, but actually we're starting from a base that's better than that. And then in terms of whether additional cost risks are coming from, it's a wide range of activities. Most of these have been put in place either in Q4 last year or Q1, but it takes time for those actions to bear fruit, but they don't happen instantly. And it's improving and the cost of our logistics improving, getting better deals from suppliers, design improvements, (indiscernible) are the ones that take the longest to come to fruition which is why we're only confident of the 25% gross margin number in sooner not sooner is because there are a number of prudence that have validated too – that have finished the designs that are validated and then put into production.\nDeepak Ahuja: And I'll add to that manufacturing process improvements both in-house and at our suppliers, to take cost out.\nElon Musk: Yeah, a number of our suppliers have really done some impressive work on cost reduction. And for some others that they just didn't believe that we do these numbers. So they didn't quite tool up for this level of production, because they’re in total predictions were that we would do in some cases 3,000 over the entire lifetime of the product. We did that last quarter, so they can't believe that those things – that these projections are real and they actually tool up and are able to deliver significant cost savings for our product supply.\nDan Galves: Okay, got you. So just a follow-up, the suppliers are cooperating with you in terms of reduces. So I guess are you still experiencing a lot of premium freight from suppliers that weren't ready to produce this volume? Are they cooperating with you in terms of the design improvements and kind of redesigning the component? And then my second question relates to cash flow. What's causing the decline from 65 million of OCF in Q1 to the guidance of neutral in Q2, and if you could remind us of your minimal cash level? Thanks.\nDeepak Ahuja: So to answer your first question, our S production rate is continuing to reduce every month that goes by, as both our suppliers have additional capacity to meet our needs and our production schedule is becoming much more stable. So it's all trending in the right direction. And then to that same point of Elon where we ended with our freight cost at the end of Q1 was better than the average for the quarter, so it gives us comfort that or confidence that we continue to reduce our cost. And then in terms of our cash flows, we are mindful of the volumes. As you can see we’re projecting lower deliveries in North America since we have quite a few cars on the board being shipped to Europe and that consumes some degree of working capital which becomes a part of our cash flow from operations and that’s a significant number. So, when you combine the lower deliveries because we’re producing for Europe and the fact that we have these cars on the board that has an impact.\nDan Galves: Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aditya Satghare with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAditya Satghare: I have two, first is on the manufacturing process. You talked about the number of manufacturing hours being reduced by 40%. Can you give us a sense of how much more room is there to go, and where does that stand in relation to your target? And then I have a follow-up.\nDeepak Ahuja: I think there’s clearly room to go further, and there are a lot of activities in our manufacturing organization that are continuing in that direction. And then towards the, in half of the year as we start to increase our production rate slightly further than our present levels that will further add to the labor reduction on a per unit basis.\nAditya Satghare: Got it. Second question on demand; when you talk about the 15,000 units per year, does that include both sort of cash and lease demand, and could you also give us some more color on when we think about the 15,000 non-U.S. units what geographies do you expect that demand to come from and maybe a little bit more color on the buyer base, sort of who potentially could be buying these cars?\nElon Musk: Yeah, we actually expect probably most of our purchases long-term will be finance purchase’s which is actually normal for premium sedans, they’re majority financed. And in fact in our case, it might end up being a super majority because, I think that the best way to appreciate the savings you get from gasoline is to look at it on a monthly basis. In the U.S. you’ll maybe save $200 to $300 a month in gasoline relative to electricity cost if it's your daily driver. In Europe obviously that number can be double; it can be maybe $500 a month if you’re driving because the cost of gasoline is twice as much. So, I think given that, I think we’ll see over time my guess is that it will be a super majority financed in one form or another. And I believe that also opens up the potential, before going to the car to a much broader -- a much large number of people. And think if, like if our car was exclusively available for purchase and not via financing I think that maybe accessible to 1% or roughly 1 million U.S. households. As a financed product with the right financing, sort of fully optimized financing product I think it's probably accessible to the top 10 million households. And then of course it depends on what percentage I have of those households will want to buy our car versus somebody else’s. But I do think that it's long-term it's primarily a financed product.\nAditya Satghare: And could you touch on sort of non-U.S. demand in terms of geographical mix and where that comes from?\nElon Musk: Yeah, sure. Well, I think we’ll see probably at least 10,000 units a year from demand in Europe, and then at least 5000 in Asia, but I mean, that could be or so much bigger number and China is kind of the wildcard here. Its worth noting that all of the cars – all the sales to-date including all the way through end of Q2 is 100% North American.\nAditya Satghare: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAdam Jonas: Elon, I know I have asked you versions of those question before and you guys have done a phenomenal job building what appears to be a viable business and a thriving business although still early and at a risky part of the lifecycle of a company. So to kind of, when you look at where your share price is and there’s likely to be tomorrow, and you think about the factors that are outside of you control to kind of make sure that all this great work your team has done doesn't go to waste potentially for those factors outside of your control. Can you share your thoughts on potentially stocking in, carrying the balance sheet a bit more with a capital increase that could further improve your chances to keep investing in the business and focusing on the product and not the economic cycle?\nElon Musk: Sure. Well, we don't have any plans right now to raise funding. Potentially we expect to be – we were positive cash flow in Q1 and we expect to be there relatively sort of neutral on cash flow in Q2. But if it was possible, we could be optimistic about raising a round, but we have spent no time on that at all. So if we were to do a round, it would be for the reasons that you mentioned which is to ensure that if there was some unexpected supply interruption, some sort of risk event, but should potentially protect against a portion of your event that there could be some merit to doing a round.\nAdam Jonas: Okay, that's very clear, Elon. Thank you. And just a follow-up to an earlier question about the geographic split. Don't know if you can give any color of the 21,000 that you expect this year, how much and by order of magnitude could come from Europe and to confirm whether they'd be any Asian numbers in this year's figure? Thank you.\nElon Musk: Obviously given that the first half year is entirely North America that also puts a flow of 10,000. If we stop shipping to North America on July 1st, then we would still have something like 10,000 North American cars. So we're not going to do that. But do not take these numbers as final in any way, but if I'm asked to sort of speculate, I think it's probably something 13,000 in North America and 5,000 in Europe and 1,000 in Asia. But this is – don't hold me to these numbers. I don't want to put – what I just (indiscernible) I want to brag to it with the appropriate confidence. That's my best guess. Those numbers could be different.\nAdam Jonas: Understood, Elon. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nPatrick Archambault: Yeah, great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good quarter. Just on the sales number, I mean if you are selling, as you say, above the 20,000 per year mark rate now, that kind of implies at least 55 a day while we were still able to get kind of the sequenced reservation data in February, I believe that fell as low as the mid-30s. So, it's come up quite a bit which is obviously great. I was hoping you could put a little bit more color on that, how much of that is – how much of an impact have you seen since the introduction of a new financed product? I'm sure there's some seasonality that we need to think about and what's the contribution to some of the international sales in this acceleration? Thanks.\nElon Musk: Our focus has been sort of more on just operating efficiently as a company and building cars that any (indiscernible) can just may improving the gross margin as well as ensuring we have really good service. We have a good, okay service. We're working hard on making the service great. I think we haven't really tried to push volume super hard yet, because I think you need to make sure that staff is in order and the car is being made as efficiently as it can be made before you try to push volume. So that's why we haven't tried to do that. And I think there's a potential for next year, a fairly significant increase in volume as we really test the depth of the demand that's out there. I think it's probably quite a bit higher than what we had originally thought. But like I said, we don't want to just ramp volume and if it's not, how it's taken care of gross margin or have that service and just dumping products on the market. I don’t think that sort of the line is course of action. But we’ll still exceed I think what most people are expecting us to do.\nPatrick Archambault: Okay. And if I can just one quick follow-up on that, I mean, did you – I know it’s still early, but have you seen a pretty good pick up from the introduction of the new financed product?\nElon Musk: Yeah, we’re definitely seeing a meaningful improvement in demand as a result of the financing project that’s – that had quite an effect on people. I mentioned sort of in a – in some prior (indiscernible) unit, like at Silver City we saw just a monster increase in demand when we went from selling people, sold the systems as purchase product versus the finance product, which really an order of magnitude difference in demand as a financed product business versus purchased. I don’t they will see anything on that scale at Tesla, but I do think its going to be pretty significant and it’s a fact.\nPatrick Archambault: That’s helpful. If I can just squeeze one more, if that’s okay, just – I know your guidance for the 25% doesn’t include ZEV credits for the fourth quarter, but I don’t know – can you help us just bracket that possibility that there might be some, are you in talks with, I mean, clearly you have the volume to have further ZEV credit, so obviously are you in talks with other manufacturers for these kinds of credits? I mean is there any kind of feeling of probability that you can give us that would allow us to sort of handicap that?\nElon Musk: I mean, I think we’re – I would realistically handicap it at zero for the fourth quarter …\nPatrick Archambault: Okay.\nElon Musk: … which is not, I mean, we will sell them if we can, but as we really anticipate saturating demand for ZEV credits, probably in the third quarter. So maybe that’s not true, but I wouldn’t – for purposes of modeling our financials, I’d recommend assuming zero percent credits in Q4.\nPatrick Archambault: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.\nElon Musk: Right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrian Johnson: Few topics. Your customer segmentation, but before that just a more data point, so if you can provide them on the factory. Can you give us a sense of what the over time hours or 10th labor hours were save run rate exiting December versus one rate March? I noticed your inventory was flat even though obviously revenue was way up. What’s you’re doing in inventory and then how does that kind of lead to some of the gross margin improvement you’re talking about.\nElon Musk: Sure. I mean, people who are working really at the sort of 78 hour week level and at the end of Q4, now they’re sort of down under 58 hours a week. And we were also been able to release a lot of the temp labor that we had added to deal with our manufacturing efficiencies and Deepak, do you want to add something on the inventory front?\nDeepak Ahuja: Yeah, just to clarify Brian, that our inventory was down by $30 million compared to end of the year, despite the fact that our production rate was significantly up and that’s clearly as a result of us better managing our inventory and our production processes.\nBrian Johnson: And on the marketing side, do you have a sense you had your data round, what the other cars in your customers garage are or sort of what the other automakers will call conquest, what they own before versus what they’re buying -- trading if any associated with the Tesla. I know you don’t do formal trading, which is what are the other cars that your sector customers typically own?\nElon Musk: Pretty wide range.\nDeepak Ahuja: Yeah, we haven’t got a formal study across all our customers, but we saw some study or a narrow time period and it was very interesting to see there was victory across the entire gamut of price points and brand. So we feel pretty good about that.\nBrian Johnson: Okay, thanks.\nElon Musk: Yeah it seems to be based on fundamental affordability rather than any particular prior car that they have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elaine Kwei with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nElaine Kwei: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the great progress there. I was actually wondering how development on the Model X is progressing at this point, if any of that 20 million CapEx is going to the X and if R\u0026D is there as well, and just the launch for early 2014?\nElon Musk: Well, we certainly are making progress on the Model X. Our focus in the second quarter is to finalize the design, so it will be internal economics and the shape of the car. It isn't yet our top focus because our top focus is on improving the efficiency of Model S production and service. But it will become our top focus towards the end of this year. We are expecting to start production of Model X towards the end of the next year rather than the beginning, but I think we've already stated that a few times. So I don't think – just for everyone let's just say that's not new news.\nElaine Kwei: All right, that's great. And actually on the production efficiency with the raw material decline in the quarter, how much of that was volume versus better purchasing strategies or negotiating with suppliers or a benefit from low commodities and how much more benefit do you think they would be to gain there?\nDeepak Ahuja: Well, I think the biggest chunk was volume. Clearly, as our cost per unit goes down, the absolute amount of inventory we carry for the same number of cars is coming down. But I think it was primarily us managing our inventory better and that was contributing towards our working capital and improvement in our cash flows.\nElaine Kwei: Okay, great. And just I have this last one real quick. What is the – do you have a picture of what the 60 kilowatt hour mix looks like at this point and are most people taking the Supercharger option on that? Thank you.\nElon Musk: We do think the mix 60 kilowatt hour is going to increase. We think more people will find – I mean long term, I think it might be a majority of people who buy the 60 kilowatt hour version. But thus far it's been sort of more like at the kind of 35% level on the 60 kilowatt hour car, but I think that's going to increase. I think roughly half of people are enabling Supercharger at the time of purchase, but I think that number is likely to – I think that may increase in the future. You can enable the Supercharger at any time after buying the car for a slightly higher amount. So I think over time, most 60 kilowatt hour cars will have the Supercharger enabled either by the initial buyer or a future buyer.\nElaine Kwei: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty \u0026 Company. Your line is open.\nAndrea James: Just to kind of follow-up a little bit, you sort of put aside the Model X, and the Gen3, you're focusing your resources on getting the Model S right and taking the cost out, and I guess what metrics do you look at internally where you can say, okay, this product's progress is satisfactory, let's start diverting more resources onto the next stage of Tesla?\nElon Musk: We're already doing that. We're actually already diverting resources onto the next stage. So that will keep increasing through this quarter and next. And probably by sometime next quarter, middle or end of next quarter, our future products will be our priority because we'll be oriented to be or at least we will have done the things we needed to do in order to achieve our gross margin numbers. Because of the time taken from when the parts are ordered to arriving, to be put in the car, car gets sold to a customer, we receive a check. It's kind of a couple of months in there. So even when we've made a cost improvement, it takes, call it, six to eight weeks for that cost improvement to actually show up in our financials. So even though we see that – unless we really screwed the pooch, you'll see the 25% gross margin number in Q4. The actions necessary to take that actually have been completed in Q3, which means that we will in Q3 have turned to Model X and other things as our priority.\nAndrea James: Well, thanks. That’s helpful, and it does give us a sense of where the confidence is coming from. And just like, on the lease accounting and on the financing program; can you give us a sense of maybe even update your GAAP guidance and what's sort of the take rate that you’re expecting on the financing program?\nDeepak Ahuja: So far we’re seeing about 25% take rate, but as we answer, we’ll continue to see an increase in the take rate. Any thoughts?\nElon Musk: Yeah, actually there seems to be an out-financing program and financing in general because a lot of customers will finance through an institution that’s not us. I mean, I think the total number, state of the cars being financed is probably halfish of which half of those are through the Tesla financing program in partnership with Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank. So, that’s – I guess, the way to think about it. But I like to, I do think that the percentage of finance prices will increase both Tesla financed and third party finance.\nAndrea James: Okay, thank you. And then one more; does the word cancellation mean anything anymore now that you’re changing how you do your reservation. Are you still taking a down-payment and then locking them, and can you just talk a little bit about how that changed?\nElon Musk: Yeah, so now we’ve changed the (indiscernible) because previously it was kind of (indiscernible) we’re making it hard for people to buy the car. You’d see, if you put down $5000 of reservation without actually configuring the car or knowing how much it costs, and then a lot of people would kind of get shocked by; oh, if you had all options you want, its more specific than you think, so then they cancel. So, now we don’t do that and (indiscernible) you now order the car with the configuration that you want. You’ve got two weeks to change that configuration or cancel, and then after two weeks the deposit becomes non-refundable and the configuration is locked. So, that’s sort of how things are working now.\nAndrea James: And the deposit is still …?\nElon Musk: I should mention we’re not thinking of reducing the initial deposit number, because we don’t – we don’t really need the cash at this point. And when somebody puts down 5K they – we’ve got to pay credit card processing fees on that, so it's kind of an unnecessary cost. So we’re thinking about reducing it from $5000 to some other number. We haven't made a final decision on that, but I think it probably makes sense just in terms of the cost reduction.\nAndrea James: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the call. The first question would be, I guess on lease accounting. Can you help us understand the potential affect on margins? And then also I think you mentioned that there would be no cash flow impact on that, but I mean, wouldn’t receivables naturally increase with this and can you just help me understand that.\nDeepak Ahuja: Yeah, so the receivables would have increased because now this is a retail sale. We get the full cash for selling this car upfront. This is not a lease sale per se. The reason we’re taking lease accounting is because we’re offering this resale value guarantee at the end of it and for the price that I’ll technically …\nElon Musk: Yeah, (indiscernible) lease. Yeah.\nDeepak Ahuja: Yeah. So, yeah our receivables don’t go up on our balance sheet. Our income statement is affected, because we have to amortize our revenue and be cost over a period of 36 months in this case to our retail value guarantee. So, the interesting thing is from a margin point of view as a percentage. There’s really not a significant impact, but obviously the absolute dollar amount of the margin is lower since you’re not recognizing the entire income upfront.\nElon Musk: Yeah, it actually, I mean, our margin is slightly improved the financing versus approaches, because we’re sharing the interest revenue that’s generated by the Tesla finance partners.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, great.\nElon Musk: But we’ll get the full cash up front, (indiscernible) slightly more cash than it was purchases.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, and then in terms of the 25% gross margin target in the fourth quarter, now was this always kind of an exit rate to 25% or is this kind of a change in stats?\nElon Musk: No, no change really. I'd say we're – we think we'll be at 25% on average for all of Q4. I'm fairly certain we'll be at 25% before the end of Q4 and I think it's likely that will be a 25% on average in Q4.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.\nJeff Evanson: Patrick, unfortunately we probably only have time for one more questioner.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAmy Carroll: Hi. This is actually Amy Carroll for Ryan Brinkman. A good quarter. I just had a quick question regarding the traffic and storage. Just wondering what you guys are seeing and if you could kind of help us think about when these people come to the stores, what you're seeing in percentage of conversion rate? Also, I think in the first quarter you mentioned that some of the higher costs which related to things not going out perfectly through the door, if you're still seeing that? I know you're servicing business is kind of still early, but what are you seeing in terms of usage and kind of just giving us a little bit more color on that, that'd be appreciated.\nElon Musk: Okay. I'm not sure I totally understand the questions, but…\nAmy Carroll: The first question was just basically like when somebody comes to the door, how do your stores – like what you're converting in terms of like actual sales?\nElon Musk: Well, we have a huge number of people come through our stores.\nDeepak Ahuja: Initially an excess of 1 million people per quarter just for our new design stores that we have. I mean our stores are in high…\nElon Musk: It's a low percentage conversion. I mean a lot of people in and educate them about Tesla and the brand. So that's our marketing strategy which is different from a typical car company. And so just a typical metric of conversion for traffic is not exactly applicable. I mean there's a lot of people that buy T-shirt. Our apparel sales are actually not bad. I think we could actually do a lot more on that front. We actually have millions of dollars in apparel sales, but we're not really trying hard. I think probably a better metric would be conversion after – of a qualified lead after a test drive. And we're seeing something like 25% conversion after a test drive which is quite high.\nAmy Carroll: That's helpful. Okay, and then just like on the service front if you're seeing like what percentage of people using it and what are some of the more common issues on that?\nElon Musk: As I said, there'd be a service announcement. Our service has been okay but not great, but it's improving swiftly with these passing weeks. And we did have some issues there with – we've got quite a fancy door handle and occasionally the sensor would malfunction on the door handle. So you pull on the door handle and it wouldn't open. Obviously, it's quite taxing for a customer. But we've addressed that root cause and so essentially the door handle incidents have gone to virtually zero since we introduced the new version of the door handle and then we're retroactively addressing door handle issues or addressing for the fleet that's on the road, we're kind of fixing the door handles which in a lot of cases just can be done with a remote firmware update. I think the door handle has been a issue; we've actually ironically had an issue with the 12 volt lead-acid battery. There's a little 12 volt lead-acid auxiliary battery that we bought from quite a reputable supplier, American company who then outsourced it to China, who then outsourced it to Vietnam. And so we thought we’re getting fairly good battery, but by the time it have been outsourced to multiple levels, it turned out to be not so great. And so we have to – number of those batteries have had a much shorter life than expected, so that cause some customer unhappiness. We’re since implemented a few months ago; much better screening of the battery packs and now have a substantially improved pack going into cars.\nAmy Carroll: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our Q\u0026A session. I will turn it back to Jeff Evanson for closing remarks.\nJeff Evanson: All right, Patrick. Well, I don’t have much to say, but thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today’s program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you Ms. Murphy. You may begin.\nPamela Murphy: Good morning and welcome to Incyte’s first quarter, 2013 conference call. On the call today are Paul Friedman, Incyte’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Daly, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, Executive Vice President, Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer; and Eric Siegel, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, then Dave will describe our first quarter financial results and Jim will follow with an update on the ongoing commercialization of Jakafi. Paul will close with a description of the rest of the pipeline and then open up the call for Q\u0026A. Before beginning, we like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi, and other indications, as well as other compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents. Paul.\nPaul Friedman: Good morning everyone. The first quarter was quite productive for Incyte. We had solid growth for Jakafi, which is obviously important from a revenue perspective, but the new prescription also represent patients who may experience the benefits of the first FDA approved treatment for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. At the same time we continue to progress the development of Jakafi and other potential indications. Phase III response study of Jakafi in polycythemia vera is fully enrolled and expected to read out in early ‘14, and the results from the Phase II recap study of Jakafi in pancreatic cancer are expected in the second half of this year. These are important potential growth catalysts for Jakafi in new patient populations with high unmet medical need. Later in the call I’ll share some more information with you about the pipeline and Jim will outline activities that we believe will lead to continued solid growth for Jakafi. But first, I’ll turn the call over to David to review our financial performance in the first quarter.\nDave Hastings: Thanks Paul and good morning everybody. Lets begin with Jakafi, for which we recorded $48.3 million of first quarter net product revenues. Additionally we recorded $5.9 million in product royalties from Novartis, for sales for Jakavi outside the United States. In addition we announced that week that we earned a $25 million milestone from Novartis, based on the formal initiation of a Phase II clinical trial, the c-MET Inhibitor 28060. This amount will be received and recorded as revenue in the second quarter. Our gross net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $5.1 million or 9.5% for the first quarter. As I mentioned in our last call, we expected our growth to net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter than the rest of the year, because of our share of the doughnut hole for Medicare Part B patients. We still expect that our full year gross net adjustment will range from 8% to 9%. Our cost of goods sold for the first quarter was immaterial, as our starting to finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R\u0026D prior to FDA approval. In terms of operating expenses, SG\u0026A was within our expectations, while R\u0026D expense came in slightly below our expectations. From a cash perspective we ended the quarter with $270 million. This is a strong cash position and we have multiple sources of cash flow now. Therefore we are well positioned to fund our growth. Jim will now provide more color around Jakafi performance in the first quarter. Jim.\nJim Daly: Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued solid execution of our growth strategy for Jakafi in MF. We added new patients at a steady rate consistent with the previous quarters, while making gradual but meaningful improvement in persistency. In terms of quarter-over-quarter growth, net revenues grew 12% with the following components of growth. Underlying demand is measured by bottles dispensed and accounts for approximately 7%, net price accounted for approximately 2%, and inventory accounted for approximately 3%. Channel inventories remain within a consistent normal range of 3 to 3.5 weeks. In the quarter we continue to add new patients at a steady rate. Roughly half of new patient starts came from new prescribers, with the remaining half coming from repeat prescribers. We continue to make inroads with our target physicians. We believe later adopters are motivated by an increased awareness of the overall survival data presented at ASH, while exiting prescribers are motivated by the impressive improvement in spleen volume and constitutional symptoms they are seeing in their MF patients. Through the first quarter, more than 40% of our target prescribers have prescribed Jakafi at least once and about one-third of those have written for two or more patients. We expect breadth and depth of prescribing to continue to expand, driven by one, educational programs to help physicians identify appropriate new patients, including those who do not carry the JAK2 V617F mutation. We continue to reinforce the fact that Jakafi is targeted to the JAK pathway and not necessarily any particular mutation. Number two, programs including direct to patient and allied health professional activities to assist MF patients in communicating their symptoms to their physicians; and finally three, positive experience as a catalyst to treat more patients. Turing to persistency, we continue to see increasing use of lower dosage strengths, which is driven by physicians individualizing treatment, in particular by starting patients at appropriate doses and titrating downward if medically necessary. In the first quarter of 2013, five and 10 milligrams strengths represented approximately 44% of dispensed bottles, versus 37% in the first half and 41% in the second half of last year. Absent the use of dose titration or lower doses, patients with low baseline hemoglobin and/or platelet accounts are at the highest risk for discontinuation in the first eight to 12 weeks. The use of lower doses in these populations is increasing and we expect the trend to continue as a result of (1) rapid and appropriate follow-up by our field base sales and medical teams with new prescribes; (2) enhanced outreach to patients through Incyte cares and specialty pharmacies; (3) increased awareness by prescribers of additional dose titration data from ASH. Additionally, we now have data from our studies of patients with low platelets and we expect expanded dosing guidance in our label sometime in the second quarter. To assist physicians in titrating patients appropriately, we introduced the Jakafi dose modification program late in the first quarter, which enables physicians to order a lower strength bottle of Jakafi free of charge, for any patient requiring a dose titration in 21 days or less from receiving their last prescription. The objective of this program is to make it as easy as possible, both financially and administratively for a physician to down titrate to the most appropriate dose for a given patient. While early in its implementation, we are seeing active utilization of the program and it is serving as an effective tool to highlight the importance of dose modification, especially during the first eight to 12 weeks of treatment. In summary, our first quarter performance is consistent with our expectations for steady growth in dispensed bottles, largely driven by new patients and a realistically achievable improvement and persistency. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our guidance of $210 million to $225 million in net sales in 2013. In a moment Paul will talk about our pipeline, which had near, mid and long term catalysts. I’m especially excited about the PV indication for Jakafi. With the response route fully recruited, the commercial team is actively preparing for a potential approval and launch by the end of next year. Now I’ll turn it back to Paul.\nPaul Friedman: Okay, thanks Jim. I’ll start with Jakafi. While abstracts for ASCO haven’t been posted, the titles are now public and there is an oral presentation involving Jakafi, entitled ‘Exploratory Analysis of the Effect of Ruxolitinib on Bone Marrow Morphology in Patients with Myelofibrosis.’ The lead author, professor Hans-Michael Kvasnicka, a world recognized hematopathologist from [Agartha] (ph) University, Germany, is exploring the effects of treatment on bone marrow fibrosis in this patient population. While it’s not appropriate for me to provide detail about the ASCO presentation, I can tell you that the preliminary findings originally presented by European leukemia net chair, professor Tiziano Barbui, at a closed session of the EON Annual meeting in February, suggests that long term use of Jakafi, slows the rate of advancement of bone marrow fibrosis compared to matched historical controls, and with some patients can result in a reduction in the amount of bone marrow fibrosis. So we’re looking forward to this presentation at ASCO in June. Our most advanced programs in Jakafi are in polycythemia vera and pancreatic cancer. We expect to see results from response to PB trial we’re conducting in partnership with Novartis in early ‘14, which keeps us on track to file a supplemental NDA in the first half of ‘14. Our second trial in PV called RELIEF is evaluating symptomatic benefit, and while this study is not part of the SPA, the Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA, and is therefore not required for FDA approval. When completed we do plan to submit results to support labeling claims on symptomatic benefit in PV. In the second half of this year we expect to have results from recap, the double blind Phase II trial in patients with pancreatic cancer, in which overall survival is the primary endpoint. As we previously mentioned, the trials drug safety and monitoring board conducted a pre specified interim analysis of safety, as well as efficacy at the end of 2012 and recommended that the study continued to completion. As there is ample evidence suggesting this regulation of the JAK pathway plays a key role in a variety of malignancies, including solid tumors beyond pancreatic cancer. It’s of interest to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib, as well our other JAK inhibitors in additional malignancies. In particular, given the importance of cytotoxic chemotherapy to many first and second lined solid tumor treatment regiments, we’ve initiated an open label Phase I trial of ruxolitinib in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with advanced solid tumors, to better understand the tolerability of ruxolitinib when combined with myelosuppressive agents. From the results anticipated in 2014, we expect to establish the maximum dose of ruxolitinib tolerated when used in combination with given chemotherapeutic regiments. Our first proprietary JAK1 inhibitor, INCB39110 is being studied in proof of concept trials in myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Results from these trials should help us select the most appropriate indications for further development. We plan to share these results at appropriate scientific meetings in the second half of this year. Now we have a second JAK1 inhibitor, INCB47986, which has now entered Phase I clinical development. Having two distinct JAK1 inhibitor compounds gives us a greater number of options with the program, including the opportunity to pursue both oncologic and chronic inflammatory indications, but with distinct molecules. We are planning to start a study this summer with one of our JAK1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy to better understand how JAK1 inhibitors could be used in this setting and we’re going to be able to compare the results with what we’ve seen with ruxolitinib in a similar patient group. Our second JAK 1, JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib, licensed to Lilly, is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis. There are also two ongoing Phase II trials evaluating baricitinib as a treatment for psoriasis and for diabetic nephropathy respectively. In addition to our JAK programs, there’s several other compounds in clinical development such as our c-MET inhibitor, as well as an indoleamine dioxygenase or IDO inhibitor. The c-MET inhibitor, INCB28060 is licensed to Novartis and they recently initiated a Phase II clinical trial, evaluating the compound as monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Our IDO inhibitor for immunologic treatment of tumors is in Phase II development for melanoma and for ovarian cancer. The results of a Phase I study of the compound will be the subject of poster presentation at ASCO. The program has also generated interest among other researchers, with three investigator sponsor trials being readied for initiation. Beyond these programs we have several early stage programs that address attractive oncologic targets, that link well with ruxolitinib and our current development pipeline, and I’d expect to see some of these programs enter the clinic this year and early next year. With that operator, lets open the lines for questions please.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Roden, your line is live. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.\nDo Kim: Hi. This is actually Do Kim in for Ian. A couple of questions; we were wondering if you saw any sense of seasonality in the Jakafi sales number, given the sort of general weakness reported by most of the other pharma and biotech companies and also as we look ahead to the dose titration label update, how should we think about its impact on second half sales in terms of growth persistence and new patient adds? Thank you.\nPaul Friedman: Yes, on the question with respect to seasonality, as you indicated, the first quarter is usually the most difficult for a couple of reasons, particularly from products that are relatively expensive and have a significant percentage of reimbursement through Medicare Part D, because you have patients reentering the donut hole and you have deductibles being reset. As we look at the fourth quarter prescriptions and compare them to the first quarter prescription, we probably had a small level of what we call shoebox prescriptions, where patients may try to get their last prescription in December after they are through the donut hole and after their deductible has been fully met, and so there is a slight drop off in the first quarter, but I wouldn’t say it was significant. As you see, our underlying demand remained strong in the first quarter. So I think we were able to power through that. The other issue is that we simply had a reduced number of shipping days in the first quarter. The first quarter had 52 shipping days versus 64 in the fourth quarter. But despite that, I think we had a very solid first quarter and we carried good momentum in to the second. Regarding the persistence trend and the new patient start trends for the rest of the year, we are not going to quantify those beyond what we said in the prepared remarks, but we are encouraged by the fact that the new patient starts remain strong, consistent with previous quarters, and we are seeing gradual, but important improvement in persistence, and those two drivers give us the confidence that we’ll achieve our guidance for the year.\nDo Kim: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nCory Kasimov: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions; a couple of them for you. First of all, has been any feedback from the field regarding potential concerns over PML and what would you expect the underlined incidents to be in myelofibrosis, and then I have a follow-up.\nJim Daly: Hi Cory, this is Jim. Cory, we’ve had zero feedback from the field regarding PML and now I’ll turn it over to...\nPaul Friedman: Yes Rich, I don’t think you can put a percentage on it. It’s a rare enough entity that in Myelofibrosis and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, its just, I don’t think you can put a percentage on.\nRich Levy: It’s hard to do. I mean when we look back at the FDA database from several years ago, there were a number of different drugs that were looked at and there were more cases than you might expect. But when you look at the literature, and when you know that there is going to be under reporting, even for things like PML. So it’s hard to say exactly. But it’s not going to be a big number, spontaneous or with the use of a drug, but it’s also not to say that you would never expect another one to happen, even in the absence of the drug.\nCory Kasimov: Okay. And then next question is just more on the relative breakdown in the Jakafi doses being used. So it’s encouraging that the 5 and 10 mg doses continue to increase. But I’m wonder, is there any pushback at all on using those lower does. I guess I want to get your sense on if we should expect that 44% shortage you have now to keep growing and become in time, kind of represent the vast majority of initial prescriptions. Thanks.\nPaul Friedman: Yes, I wouldn’t necessarily say initial Cory. Whether it’s starting dose and/or titration, we do expect the 5 and 10 to increase as a share of total doses. So we would expect to see that 44% grow over time.\nCory Kasimov: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Roden: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the progress and thanks for getting me back in here. I just wanted to get into the gross net a little bit. I’m trying to better understand what the potential impact or the financial impact was of the donut hole in particular. And also in inventories you talk about, inventory accounted for 3% of the sequential growth, but I’m just trying to understand if that represents a build or if that’s just the growth that’s commensurate with the growth in demand, underlying demand, and then I have a pipeline question if I may.\nDave Hastings: On the gross to net, as we discussed on the prepared remarks, came in at about 9.5%, but the guidance overall did not change. So our gross net for the year should range somewhere between 8% and 9%. So that should give you a sense for the impact on the increased donut hole exposure for the quarter. The inventory are at normal levels, so it’s really commensurate with the growth in product sales.\nMatthew Roden: Okay, understood. And then on the pipeline, Paul or Rich, can you speak to the differences between your two JAK1 inhibitors? Is there something really different between these two products that you would need to bring sort of complementary assets for those or just the question of being or to cover more indications across cancer and information?\nPaul Friedman: Well, so they are different in terms of, they have a distinct pharmacokinetic difference and I just would like to leave it at that. The first compound has turned out to be much more interesting than I frankly thought it was going to be. It’s a very nice compound, and we are looking forward to presenting our results on that compound and the three indications at which we are looking at the second half of the year. We did with JAK1, JAK2 want and I think it turned out to be the right way to go, to have a distinct compound for inflammatory diseases and one for oncologic indications and that resulted in Ruxolitinib and Baricitinib and we are taking the same approach here. But the second compound, it’s early days and I just don’t think I can say much more than that. Rich, do you have anything else to add to that?\nRich Levy: No.\nMatthew Roden: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please proceed with our question. Heather Behanna - JMP Securities Hi, good morning. It’s Heather in for Liisa. Just a quick question; if you could give us any more color just sort of about how persistence rates have continued over time and just give us a little more color on new patients versus continuing patients.\nPaul Friedman: I can’t give you much more color than what we give you in the prepared comments. Our best quantification of persistence right now is seen in our ability to drive titration and use of lower doses and we are seeing that happening. Again, our new patient starts a very consistent. As we have communicated previously, we do expect to see a very modest deceleration in new patient starts, more weighted towards the back end of the year than the front-end of the year, and we do expect to see a modest, but important increase in persistence over the course of the year and that’s really exactly what we are seeing. That takes us into our guidance to 210 to 225.\nHeather Behanna: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Abrahams: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Given the recent rejection of zelgen in Europe, I was wondering if you and your partner had any changes to the way you might approach the development of Baricitinib. Any tweaks you might make to the development program? And how confident are you in the differentiation of baricitinib from zelgens, such that you don’t believe you would necessarily fall into the same pitfalls that they did. And I have a quick follow-up.\nPaul Friedman: So, this is Paul and then I’ll ask Rich to add anything that he thinks I didn’t cover or didn’t make clear enough and I really think at the end of the day, the question is best posed to Lilly, but we certainly can pine on it and there is some very important aspects to the question that you asked. In particular, we all listened to the advisory committee that was conducted with Pfizer, and based on what we learned during that, and knowing what Pfizer’s Phase III study was, we used the learning’s from the Pfizer structure study to do a couple of things. One is to increase the sample size, and the second, very importantly, was to enrich for patients more at risk in the RA population for structural deterioration in the absence of effective treatment. And so we, and I believe Lilly remained quite confident in the ability to demonstrate an improvement in structure in the target population. Beyond that, and I think importantly, although the proof will be in the pudding when Phase III is complete or that the Phase II data with baricitinib, it’s a JAK inhibitor that spares JAK 3 in contrast to tofacitinib. The Phase II has not been associated with opportunistic interactions, other than a few cases of uncomplicated zoster, shingles for example or with malignancies. And while the Phase III data will be important to confirm this profile, we may well see a better risk benefit profile than we have seen with tofacitinib. And so we remain confident in the potential approval for Baricitinib for RA in the EU, as well as in the United States and around the world. Rich.\nRich Levy: Yes, the only thing I’d add is, I think that because tofacitinib is going to potentially be approved with the 5-milligram dose and not the 10, and they had their positive structure data at 10, I think that also had an effect. And with respect to Baricitinib, the 4-milligram dose, it was at the top dose that Lilly is studying, is looking really good, looked really good in Phase II from a safety perspective, as well as from and efficacy perspective. They have MRI data, even though they haven’t had x-ray data to support that it was going to have effects on bone. They have that data from their MRI studies. So as Paul said, we think it’s going to be safe enough to have the top doses go through, and that should with the enhanced design of the structure study come out positive. So I think in some ways we are looking at this as an opportunity.\nBrian Abrahams: That’s very helpful, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up and I’ll hop back into queue. With the trials, the Phase II for 110 and continuing to move along, can you give us any more clarity on which of those trial readouts we might expect in the back half of this year? Thanks.\nPaul Friedman: Yes. So the psoriasis study may very well get presented at EADV, I think which is in October in Istanbul I believe. The rheumatoid arthritis data may very well get presented at ACR, and the myelofibrosis data may very well get presented at ASH. But all of those, none of them have been – either some of them have not even been submitted yet and others have not heard back until they’ll be accepted for presentation. Should any of those not happen, we’ll think about backup plans or potentially just top line fairly than otherwise expected.\nBrian Abrahams: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jappy: Hi, this is Andrew on the line for Salveen. My question is on the pancreatic cancer, kind of how we should think about the expectations there, and what you need to see in that trial to maybe get a label expansion. If there’s any significant improvement in OS that would be necessary or would you need to go to Phase III. Thanks.\nPaul Friedman: Okay. So the study was designed as clearly a Phase II study, one that where we did not have expectations, but this study by itself would lead to any type of approval, accelerated or otherwise. In pancreatic cancer would be the idea of being that we’d mostly likely need to go Phase III. Is there a possibility that the results could be so robust that we might actually approach FDA, trying to get an accelerated approval on this, based on a commitment to do a second study later? Its possible, but I wouldn’t suggest that that’s our expectation. And in terms of things like what does the hazard ratio need to be, it has to be in a range where we feel comfortable that it’s worth doing another study, that wouldn’t be so large, and I think there’s a good chance that that will be the case. But in terms of a hazard ratio that would be necessary for FDA to consider this as a basis of approval by itself, I really wouldn’t want to try to predict that. Things are changing a little bit. At FDA, there’s more emphasis on breakthrough drugs. The oncology divisions have been calling a lot of things, breakthrough drugs lately, so I don’t know that you can necessarily just go on past experience, given the changes that are going on down there right now.\nAndrew Jappy: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nChristina Zhang: Hi, this is Christina on behalf of Ying Huang. I know you mentioned that you are planning to net the RA data for your preparatory JAK 110, potentially at ACR. But I just wanted to see if there was any more data on the 12 design, given that I didn’t see it listed on criticaltrials.gov, but I did see the MSN psoriasis trails on there. Thanks.\nPaul Friedman: I’m pretty sure it has to be on clinicaltrials.gov, I just don’t know what the – right now we’d initially done some one-month data, which was kind of an accelerating dosing paradigm with a few placebo patients included. Once we got toxicology data to be able to allow us to do three months, we are now doing parallel groups of, I believe three or four different doses plus placebo. The study is not big by any means. These are not meant to be studies that would go directly to Phase III, but they gives us a real sense of what the drug does in this indication, in the sense of the doses that may be necessary in a variety of anti-inflammatory indications. And it’s a three 12-week readout not as apposed to the one-week readout we had before. And I expect that if this was to be accepted for presentation at ACR, we would present both, the results of the one-month data, as well as the updated three-month data.\nChristina Zhang: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen \u0026 Company. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Schmidt: Thanks for taking my questions. Intrigue by Rich’s comment, that the Phase II pancreatic trial has a good chance of producing a good enough hazard ratio to go to Phase III and also I guess about your decision to start the gem/abraxane combo study ahead of reporting out the Phase II data. What do you guys know or see about the Phase 2 trial?\nRich Levy: Maybe I misheard you or maybe you misheard me. I said I didn’t think there was a good chance that the data would be strong enough to go directly to a registration, just because its a small study, it’s a 135 patients.\nEric Schmidt: But Rich, I thought you said it would be most likely supportive of a Phase III trial, based on the Phase II showing a good enough hazard ratio.\nRich Levy: That’s not based on data. I think the rationale that we’ve had all along has been a good one, and what I was trying to say is that one of the considerations would be how large the study would need to be in order to go to Phase III, depending upon the hazard ratio that we actually see. All we know in terms of data is that it past the futility analysis, which means that the study had at least 30% power after that analysis. And so now that I’ve clarified that, can you remind me what you’re specific question was?\nEric Schmidt: That’s what I wanted to know. I guess that you don’t see the data and you don’t have any other knowledge than what the DSLV elected to do.\nRich Levy: That’s correct.\nEric Schmidt: Okay. And then as a second question, maybe for Jim, on the potential impact from this new dose titration program, is it possible we would see negative sales impact in Q2 as more patients select the free few weeks of drug?\nJim Daly: No. We don’t anticipate any negative revenue impact. If anything Eric, I think you’ll see a positive revenue impact longer-term. We just implemented and in the past several weeks, but we are seeing good activity, but we don’t anticipate any negative revenue impact from it.\nEric Schmidt: Okay, thanks. And then last question for Dave if I may, it looks like you saw 4% pricing benefit last quarter from the November price hike, another 2% this quarter, adding up to maybe 6%. Is that all we are going to see as the 9% hike? Are you going to basically recognize about two-thirds of that or is there more to come?\nDave Hastings: Well, I think that’s basically it, right? I mean that will be fully baked in going forward at this point, Eric.\nEric Schmidt: So in general for your price hikes, we should assume about two-thirds will be realized?\nPaul Friedman: Lets have that one back. If the price increased November 16, absent any increase in gross to net, we would have realized a 5% price increase in the quarter.\nDave Hastings: Yes, the 2% is that and net of the gross in that impact there.\nEric Schmidt: Okay, so we probably will see a little more price hike, because you don’t have the same gross to net in Q2.\nDave Hastings: That’s correct.\nEric Schmidt: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nRachel McMinn: Yes, I have two questions. As we go into ASCO, I wanted to try to pick your brain Rich or Paul on how to think about the fibrosis remodeling data that we’re going to see for Jakafi. A couple of years ago there was no improvement in fibrosis and that was considered a bad thing and now that we are seeing it, there is some discussion about, oh I’m not sure how it matters, because fibrosis is not correlated to survival outcomes. So it seems like a circular argument to me, but I wanted to pick your brain on that. And then just secondarily, just going back to the JAK1 inhibitor for a minute, you said before that its got to be differentiated from Baricitinib, in order for you to really invest in two inflammatory programs, and I wanted to again get your sense of, is that the proof that you are seeing. Is there something that’s differentiated enough or we should expect the JAK1 inhibitor to be further developed in RA beyond just the Phase II? Thank you.\nPaul Friedman: Okay. So first on this fibrosis. I mean in the past what we have seen was that we were not seeing a lot of reversal of fibrosis. As you can see, if you do a bone marrow transplant and then within six months to a year, you can often see less fiber in the marrow. So it’s really only when you got to compare to a matched historical control of patients who had received HU, that we realize the main finding is that you are seeing less progression. It’s progressing more slowly than that much control, and also that there are some patients and I can’t release the percentage of patients that actually had decreases in the amount of fibrosis in the marrow. So is that a game changer? I don’t really think so. I mean, as you said, I don’t know that that changes the view on – we know we have data out there saying there’s an improvement in survival. It was dependent or independent of fibrosis, not sure it really makes a difference there. But I think that probably some physicians out there that would be swayed by that sort of data that may have not been swayed by survival from studies that were not exactly planned around survival and that symptoms was one thing, maybe there will be some patients, maybe some physicians will start patients who are not as symptomatic, but I don’t think it’s a game changer by any means and we can talk about it more when the data is actually presented. With respect to the second question on differentiation, I mean it’s not just a question of differentiated from Baricitinib. It’s a question of differentiation from the range of new competitors that may exist at the time, and so we are not going to get into what we may or may not know about our results at this time. We are saving that until we have more complete data and give some of those presentations at the meetings I talked about earlier, in both psoriasis and RA on the inflammation side. But I will say that these are large investments and to bring these drugs to markets for these indications and I would not see us going forward just to have a late entry need to. So they would need to be some level of differentiation.\nRachel McMinn: And just one quick one for me. Assume that PML is not going to be reported in the FDA label for Jakafi. Have you had your discussions with regulatory agencies, and that’s just not an issue?\nPaul Friedman: We’ve actually proposed, mention of PML in the package insert. I’m not going to get into exactly where and how, and FDA has verbally been very much in agreement with what we had proposed. But they still haven’t made a final decision; maybe it needs to go up to other levels before it finally gets decided. And we’re not going to try to speculate exactly what that is, but since we’ve actually proposed something there, I can give you a clear view that there will be something there, because they are not going to say don’t put anything in.\nRachel McMinn: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Friedman: Hi, thanks for taking the question. It’s just around the volume growth that you guys had this quarter. It looks like if I calculate, it was about 3 million of sort of organic volume growth, which is about half of what you guys reported last quarter and if this is the new steady-state, it puts you at the bottom end of guidance. So I guess I’m just wondering what you think is going to change this year to reaccelerate the volume growth and the organic growth that puts you above that bottom end.\nJim Daly: Hi David, this is Jim. David I would be very careful drawing a trend line from fourth quarter to first quarter. Because as we mentioned earlier, you can’t see some additional sales at end of the fourth quarter, and it’s generally as you’ve seen for the industry, it’s a pretty difficult comparison, fourth quarter versus first quarter. Having said that, we remain very confident in our guidance, and quite frankly I think, let me send you right there, we remain very confident in $210 million and $225 million this year.\nDavid Friedman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Skip Klein with Gauss Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSkip Klein: Great, thank you. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of an update on the competitive environment, what’s going on at the Galapagos still where the Jakarta study stands?\nPaul Friedman: So at Galapagos they’ve announced they are I think doing 875 patients in Phase II, which is a very large Phase II program, which indicates that data has not yet been presented, but might be presented at UR for example, on their second one month study, with positive enough for them and have we to decide to continue to invest in this program, but in the absence of data, I can’t comment further. With respect to Sanofi and their JAK2 inhibitor in myelofibrosis, I mean we’ve never been that impressed with their Phase II data, in the sense that they had a fair amount of GI intolerance, not like its grade three or four GI intolerance, but why would you want to have that sort of profile when you don’t need to; Jakafi does not have that. Secondly, with the doses that they studied in the past they’ve had even more anemia than our higher doses. So we recognize clearly that they are going to be coming out there with strategies and strategies of looking at so called Ruxolitinib or Jakafi failures, if such a thing actually exists. But I think once we actually see the data and then they actually have to promote on label, we don’t really see a tremendous threat from them, but again we haven’t seen the Phase III data.\nSkip Klein: And then still at YM, if you would?\nPaul Friedman: So that one still remains many years behind. We estimated its probably – I think we estimated it would probably be in late ‘15 or early ‘‘6 launch and they said that they would be starting Phase III in the second half of this year, which is coming up in a few months and it’s been pretty much radio silence in terms of anything there. We think that that drug is not going to have some sort of magical effect on anemia that you don’t see by just simply reducing the dose of ruxolitinib to about 10 milligrams twice a day and they do have some side effects that we don’t have. But we’ll get closer to it, when they are actually about three years and see where we stand.\nSkip Klein: Great. Thanks and then one quick follow-up. I didn’t get an invitation, but is it possible that you have some champagne to celebrate the 4000 unique patients being put on drug, being put on Jakafi and/or the fact that you looked like you might have been positive cash flow in the quarter after adjusting for options and non-cash interest expense? Just questions you know, yes or no. 4000 patients look like they’ve been put on drug, chemo I believe and it looks like your project is cash flow, but I’m an old, tired analyst.\nPaul Friedman: One thing to keep in mind as you are looking at new patients being put on drug, about 10% of our patients are put on drugs through our patient access program. So as you are doing your models, I think that may be a factor that you want to keep in mind as well.\nDave Hastings: And Skip we do have multiple sources of cash flow, so we appreciate you acknowledging that. We are in good shape from the cash position.\nSkip Klein: So you have positive cash flow. I mean once you adjust for option expense and I don’t know what you are spending on capital spending, but that’s good, you’re turning the corner. Which is bottom line, 4000 patients, whether they got free drugs or not have been put on this drug.\nPaul Friedman: Yes, we are really not commenting on a specific number of patients on the product Skip.\nSkip Klein: Okay. So you didn’t open a bottle of champagne in the quarter. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Schimmer: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them quickly, will you announce if and when any additional PML events occur on Jakafi or once that’s in the label, do you not feel like you need to spread or update the Street. And second, Jim maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the progress that you are making or establishing; Incyte’s standing in the MF community, either funding research conferences, other activities that reach beyond kind of the cornerstone and how that’s been evolving over the course of this year. Thanks.\nJim Daly: So with respect to PML, I mean it kind of depends. We see an increase, we see something that is beyond what we’ve already seen, such as we say now we have won about 10,000 cases. If that was to go up, then I think we’d probably say something. If there is another 10,000 patients on drugs, exposed to the drug before you see another one, then we probably wouldn’t. So it’s really a change in the view of the risk of the drug that I think would really result in that and that probably would also be the same approach to potential changes in labeling beyond that. And can you repeat the second question about…\nPaul Friedman: The second question was more directed towards me Josh, regarding what progress are we making to develop our relationships with key opinion leaders, and Josh I think that’s one where its more productive to actually keep your head down and do the work rather than commenting on it on too frequent a basis, but obviously we have a long-term commitment to heal malignancy. Jakafi is obviously the cornerstone, but as you hear more about our pipeline. We intend to be working very closely with these physicians, these oncology academic medical centers, with the societies on a long-term basis and clearly we are making the commitment to establish Incyte as really a scientific driver in this field.\nJosh Schimmer: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with you question.\nMatt Palmer: Good morning. This is Matt Palmer in for Boris. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones actually; how significant will label expansion be for low platelet patients on your target prescriber penetration or do you expect label expansion to have a significant effect on the current prescriber usage?\nJim Daly: This is Jim. I think it will have a positive effect on both. We still have a significant number of new patient starts, where those patients have a baseline platelet count below 100,000, and I think the expanded label well help greatly with those. I also think that there will probably be some spillover on the anemia side, which is if you manage Thrombocytopenia with a start low and go slow approach, it’s not a huge leap of faith for doctors to assume that that’s a logical approach for patients with low hemoglobin as well. So, I think there will be a dual benefit both for new prescribers and current prescribers, but I think it will also extend beyond Thrombocytopenia to benefit anemia as well.\nMatt Palmer: Great, thank you. And secondly, you mentioned R\u0026D was a little bit below expectations in the quarter. Should we expect some of these expenses to be shifted into the second quarter or later into the year?\nDave Hastings: Yes, it was all timing.\nMatt Palmer: Okay, great, Thanks.\nOperator: Dr. Friedman, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nPaul Friedman: Well, thank you and thank you all for your questions and for dialing in and listening today, and we look forward to providing you with further progress as we move forward. Thanks and with that we will end the call. Good morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg: Thanks, Deborah and thanks everyone for joining us today. We made some really good progress this quarter with the growth of – in the growth and engagement of our community, the release of new products like Instagram video and advertising growth, especially on mobile. When it comes to mobile, I’m very pleased with the results. We now have more daily actives on mobile than on desktop. Nearly half a billion people use Facebook on their phones everyday and soon we’ll have more revenue on mobile than on desktop as well. This progress is the result of investments we started making more than a year-ago and in some cases years ago. I appreciate the patience and trust of our team, our community, and our investors have given us and we’re looking forward to seeing other long-term investments and achieved great results as well. One of the questions I frequently get asked are what are the big changes we want to make in the world over the next 5 or 12 years? Now that we’ve connected a 1 billion people, what is the next big ambition? There are three main goals I would like us to achieve. Connect everyone, understand the world and help build the knowledge economy. Connecting everyone is about growing our community to reach the next 5 billion people. Our mission is to give all people the power to share and make your world more open and connected. And that means everyone. Not just product in developed countries. Most people in the world, they only had the smartphones or data access, but we know that we want to be connected. We are focused on making this possible, while also strengthening engagement within our existing community. Understanding the world is that helping people share not just day-to-day updates like text messages and photos, but also building up long-term knowledge about the world. But what people are interested in, which restaurants are good, which hotels your friend’s have stayed out and so on. We should be able to build intelligent services that help you use your network that could answer lots of questions for you to note if service can. I want to read our community to create a graph of all that understanding to power this intelligence. Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create companies and jobs, using information. The way I see our advertising product, we’re just building a strong monetization engine for our Company. We are creating tools to enable new growth jobs and businesses, [indiscernible] (2 2:24) Platform to support a larger economic shift in the world based on knowledge and information. I’m proud of the work we’re doing here to help developers create apps to help local businesses, find customers, to help great brand tell their stories and this is the core part of our mission. Now let’s talk about the progress we’ve made in each of these areas. Starting with connecting everyone. The Facebook community has grown steadily this quarter, adding 45 million new monthly actives and the number of monthly active is steady or increasing across demographics and countries. One thing that surprised me as we’ve grown is I’ve always expected our ratio of daily actives to monthly actives were decreased as later technology adapters used our service. The opposite is actually been true, but now 61% of monthly actives or daily actives and that ratio has just continued to increase. In our most penetrated markets like the U.S., more than 70% of our monthly actives use our services daily. And now more than 700 million people worldwide use Facebook daily as of today. As more social services get created, one question is how that affects the sharing and time that people spend on Facebook? You can naively assume that more new services means people spend less time on Facebook, but that isn’t happening. In fact, people on average are spending more time on Facebook than ever before. It’s possible that because the market is expanding due to mobile, even as time spent per person increases on Facebook, maybe our market share can decrease. But that doesn’t seem to be happening either. So according to third-party metrics like comScore and Nielsen, Facebook share of time spent in the U.S. is either steady or increasing. Now we believe that’s either steady or increasing everywhere else as well. This makes sense to me because Facebook helps to maintain your real identity in relationship, which are universal need. We believe that if we execute well, we have a good shot at growing the amount of time that people spend using Facebook, while also maintaining or increasing our overall share of time spend. One specific demographic I want to address is U.S. teens. There has been a lot of speculation reporting that fewer teens are using Facebook. But based on our data, that just isn’t true. It’s difficult to measure this perfectly, since some young people lied of their age. But based on the best data we have, we believe that we’re close to fully penetrated in the U.S. teen demographic for a while and the number of teens using Facebook on both a daily and monthly basis has been steady over the past year and half. Teems also remain really highly engaged using Facebook. Now it’s also worth mentioning that these stats are for Facebook only. Instagram is growing quickly as well. If you combine the two services together, we believe our engagement and share of time spend are likely growing quickly throughout the world. Next, let's talk about building more useful services on the path to understanding the world. The newest product I'm most excited about from our last quarter is Instagram video. Adding video fits really naturally with the Instagram mission of capturing and sharing the world's moments. It's off to a great start. People are already uploading hours of video to Instagram every minute. I'm really proud of the team and I think they did a great job with this product. When I first talked to Kevin about this, he had a really smart insight. Instagram has always been about helping people capture moments in a way they're proud of. Filters were necessary for photos because when Instagram started, most phone cameras weren't good enough to take high quality photos. But lack of filters isn't what's holding back videos from being great. It's that they're shaky and feel unprofessional. Kevin realized that if we can deliver a product that helps people produce stable videos that would really change the landscape and I think it already is. Now some products that video fit into the flow of what people are doing and they take off quickly. Others like Graph Search and Home are completely new kinds of products and they're just going to take longer to develop. I've used the right strategy to have a balance of long-term foundational new products in ones that fit in immediate demand. We're committed to building all of these into market-leading products. Finally, let's talk about building the knowledge economy and what that means for our core business. This quarter has been a strong period for us. A lot of new businesses have signed up to advertise with us and we now have more than 1 million active advertisers. Our News Feed Ad products are working well for them. One of the things I watch most closely is the quality of our ads and peoples' sentiment around them. Right now ads on average make up about 5% or 1 in 20 stories in News Feed. We haven't measured a meaningful drop in satisfaction when we ask people about their experience with Facebook. We're comparing that to the result we get when we ask the same question to people using a version of Facebook with no feed ads at all. With that said, in recent studies people have told us that they noticed the ads more, so we're going to invest more in improving the quality. Our top priority is to expand the number of marketers and overall demand in our system rather than just increasing the number of ads that we show. We believe that this will help us improve the quality of the ads that we show by creating a more competitive auction and this will create the best experience for people who use our products, the best returns for more marketers and the best results for us. So that's my update for this quarter. We had a lot of progress in the last three months on growing our community engagement, releasing a successful major product and generating strong financial results. This quarter also marks the end of our first year as a public company and I think we created a good foundation for the future. I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works at Facebook and everyone who's a part of this great community. You are all helping to connect the world and push it forward. I'm grateful to have the chance to work with all of you on this. So thank you and thanks to everyone on this call for joining us today. I look forward to having more to share next quarter. And now, Sheryl.\nSheryl Sandberg: Thank Mark. Our advertising business gained significant momentum this quarter growing 61% year-over-year to 1.6 billion. Our mobile ad revenue grew significantly as well and is now approximately 41% of total ad revenue, up from about 30% in Q1. This growth was robust across all regions and each of our four marketing segments increased spending about this quarter. We believe this is because our ad products are delivering impressive ROI for each of these types of marketers. Direct response marketers, including ecommerce companies, increased their spent significantly. Year-over-year ad revenue from ecommerce companies doubled in the second quarter. Direct response marketers are taking advantage of our high click-through rates and competitive CTCs to grow their businesses. These marketers are typically very measurement focused and they quickly increased their budgets as we deliver compelling ROI. Revenue from mobile app install ads also continues to accelerate. The app market is relatively new but it is already large and growing very rapidly. We believe that Facebook is one of the most effective ways for developers to acquire new customers at competitive rates. We're increasing our share and helping to grow this market. Local businesses also grew spend significantly. We surpassed 1 million active advertisers this quarter, more than double the number we had only a year ago. We believe that this rapid growth is being driven by our unique ability to target ads and the simpler ad products we rolled out in the past year. We're all really excited that we can help local businesses grow around the world. One of my favorite local examples is right in our backyard, Artisan State, a San Francisco business that prints photo books. The owner told us that running News Feed ads gave him so many customers so quickly that they had to pause their campaigns to let their manufacturing catch up. Nearly 18 million local businesses now have Facebook pages, but we are excited to hit 1 million active advertisers, we know that this is just a small fraction of the local businesses on Facebook. So this remains a large growth opportunity for us. And finally, brand marketers also continue to grow spend. We have a massive and engaged audience around the world that brands can use to build awareness and drive scales. Every night 88 million to 100 million people are actively using Facebook during primetime TV hours in United States alone. One recent example is from Reckitt Benckiser, a global CGP company. Their campaign for Lysol targeted moms and drove a two times return on ad spent for their brand. Their campaign for Air Wick was even better driving a 5x return on ad spent. As they have seen these results, they have more than doubled their ad spent with us over the last year. News Feed ads are performing very well. In an analysis by Datalogix of 55 ad campaigns on Facebook over the past six months, marketers saw a median return on ad sales of three times of campaigns that did not include adding new feeds, which is very solid performance. Campaigns that included News Feed ads, the median return on ad sales was nearly double at 5.9x. During the second quarter we increased the number and type of ads in News Feed. At the same time, our click-though rates and cost-per-click metrics for News Feed ads remains strong during the quarter providing a good indicator of healthy and growing advertiser demand and continued user interest in these ads. Custom Audiences is another key product that continues to gain momentum. This product enables our clients to enhance their ad targeting by marrying their data with ours in a privacy protective way. In Q2 the number of marketers using custom audiences more than doubled relative to Q1. We also continue to innovate around our mobile app products. In April we launched ad targeting for future trends. This helps marketers, everyone from multinationals to local businesses, reach people in emerging markets who they could not easily reach before. While these ad markets are not especially large today, they'll become increasingly important in the years to come. In summary, we believe we're making strong progress executing our strategy. As I have mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in mobile measurements and product innovations. The results we are reporting today demonstrate the early returns on these investments. Looking ahead, we're enthusiastic about the launch and prospects for our business. The time people are spending on mobile devices is increasing dramatically that mobile represents just 2% of ad spent globally and 3% in the U.S. We have a massive and growing mobile user base. We have an impressive share of mobile time spent and we have one if not the most effective mobile app products. Together this positions us well to lead the mobile app market. We believe that over time, marketers will increasingly rely on Facebook not just to reach people wherever they are but to fundamentally transform the way they build their businesses. As Facebook delivers personalized experiences to over 1.1 billion people, we also have a unique opportunity to deliver a more personalized advertising experience. As I meet with marketers all around the world, I find more and more that they are understanding the benefits of this opportunity. As a result, Facebook is placed to play an essential role in the evolution of marketing. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do, but we're excited about this quarter and the opportunity in front of us. Now David.\nDavid Ebersman: Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to update you on our progress in Q2 against our key financial objectives. Increasing revenue, investing to drive our future growth and positioning the company to maximize long-term returns for our shareholders. It was a great quarter across the board as we continue to benefit from and effectively navigate the transition to mobile. Let's start with our network. Usage and engagement on Facebook remain extremely strong as evidenced by the following. On an average day in June, 699 million people used Facebook, up 27% from last year. This represents 61% of the 1.15 billion people who accessed Facebook at any point during the month of June. Additionally, time spent per person on Facebook continues to increase. An aggregate across everyone in our network, time spent on Facebook exceeded 20 billion minutes each day in June. Separately, Instagram continues to grow rapidly with impressive engagement and we announced last month we had over 130 million actives using the service. Overall we’re really pleased by the unprecedented growth in engagement of our community at this scale. Now let’s turn to the financials. In Q2, total revenue was $1.81 billion up 53% or 54% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Ad revenue was $1.6 billion up 61% in the quarter or 63% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. This was our strongest quarter in terms of advertising revenue growth since the third quarter of 2011. The performance was strong throughout the world with ad revenue in each of our geographic regions growing by greater than 15%. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by an increase in the number of marketers, overall advertising demand and the strong performance of newsfeed ads. Newsfeed ads were, they have been remarkably effective at delivering high levels of engagement a significant increase in click through rates and overall number of clicks and marketers have increased budgets meaningfully in response. Overall ad impressions were up 43% and the average price per ad was up 13% compared to last year. Ad impressions are up due to more people using our service worldwide combined with the impact of reducing the price floor late in 2012 which resulted in more ads being shown particularly in developing markets. In the U.S. and Canada where the price floor changes had a smaller impact, ad volume increased 6% and average price per ad increased over 40% year-over-year driven by the growth higher performing newsfeed ads. Total payments and other fees revenue was $214 million in Q2, an increase of 11% versus last year. Payments revenue from games specifically was up 7% so we believe 11% represents the best apples-to-apples comparison if we adjust for items such as the change in revenue recognition timing we made late last year. We were pleased to see Kings continued rapid growth on our games platform in Q2. Kings strategy of launching games like Candy Crush Saga on Facebook and subsequently launching on mobile has proved to be an effective approach that enables people to seamlessly play games across desktop and mobile and we expect other game developers to pursue a similar strategy. We believe Facebook continues to offer a compelling platform for developers to build great games and businesses. Overall ARPU increased 25% compared to last year to $1.60 per user for the quarter including a 35% increase in the United States and Canada as well as 30 plus percent gains in all our other regions. Turning now to expenses, in Q2 our GAAP total expenses were $1.25 billion, excluding stock compensation non-GAAP total expenses increased 52% to $1.02 billion primarily driven by headcount and infrastructure. We ended the quarter just shy of 5,300 employees up 33% from last year and we continue to be pleased with our success in attracting talent. Our Q2, GAAP operating income was $562 million representing 31% operating margin. Excluding stock comp our non-GAAP operating income was $794 million up 44% non-GAAP operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 39% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 37%. GAAP net income was $333 million or $0.13 per share and non-GAAP net income was $488 million or $0.19 per share. We spent $268 million on CapEx in Q2, as we continue to invest in our datacenters and facilities. While the relatively lower spend on CapEx in Q2 is partially the result of timing of purchases. It also reflects the returns from a significant effort by employees throughout the company to make our software and hardware more efficient. CapEx will remain one of our primary areas of spend since we need a powerful infrastructure to provide content rich and personalized information to all the people who use our service around the world. The projects like Open Compute and many others are providing great returns for us and helping ensure we’re able to invest our resources in a disciplined and efficient manner. Of note, free cash flow in Q2 was over $1 billion. This is much higher than we expect in coming quarters as Q2 free cash flow benefited from $419 million tax refund and light quarterly spend on CapEx. But still $1 billion in free cash flow is a nice milestone for us against an important financial metric. In Q2 similar to prior quarters, upon the vesting of employee RSUs, we withheld shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, with provides an outcome similar to Facebook having repurchased approximately $153 million worth of shares in the quarter. We ended Q2 with $10.3 billion in cash and investments. Now I want to conclude by sharing some thoughts about the second half of 2013. We expect newsfeed ads to remain the main driver of revenue growth in the second half of the year and we believe we have a great opportunity to continue to drive long-term growth by improving the quality and relevance of these ads. However remember that newsfeed ads really began to contribute to our revenue in the third and fourth quarters last year which will make for more difficult year-over-year comparisons in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2. Looking at expenses, consistent with what we said previously we plan to invest in our business and continue to expect that our total non-GAAP expenses including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp will likely grow in the neighborhood of 50% for the full-year 2013 compared to 2012. We also continue to expect that this full-year over full-year expense growth rate will be faster than our year-over-year revenue growth rate for the full-year 2013 compared to 2012. In terms of our tax rate, we expect that our Q3 and full-year non-GAAP tax rate with be a few percentage points higher than our Q2 rate and finally we expect 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.6 billion. This is down from our prior estimate of $1.8 billion due to a combination of efficiency gains and changes in timing of purchases while Q2 was a very strong quarter for us. We believe we’re executing well in particular with regard to the mobile transition, the investments we have been making over the past year are paying off, the business is growing rapidly and we’re excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now let’s open the call for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the ad revenue growth during the quarter, and it was very helpful to get the four segments broken down but, can you just help us understand a little more on the Sheryl you’re cutting on the increased number and then the types of ads in the newsfeed in 2Q and trying to understand if this is more sort of specific product driven or if this is just the combination of all the efforts that have been going into newsfeed ads essentially over the last year? Thanks.\nSheryl Sandberg: So over the past during these calls we’ve been talking about our three priorities in growing our ads business, mobile, measurement and product innovation. I think what you’re seeing here is all three of these are paying off. Obviously the transition to mobile was a really big one. We had almost no mobile ads a year-ago, were up to 41% this quarter. We have done a lot of measurement and product innovation newsfeed ads has been the most important thing we’ve done now, and we’ve done other things as well. In terms of the marketer segments, all four marketer segments are growing and contributing to our growth. So we’re seeing both the increased supply that we talked about with newsfeed ads, but also the increase in demand that all four of these marketer segments represent.\nDouglas Anmuth: And just as a follow-up, can you help us understand how impactful or how big mobile app install ads are within the mix?\nSheryl Sandberg: Yeah, we don’t break out by segment, the four market segments but again all four are growing. Mobile app install ads, we think are -- they’re small but they’re important and they’re growing rapidly. It's basically a totally new market. People who are selling either mobile apps as their revenue or things that are bought through mobile app are looking for a way to find new customers and we represent one of the only ways in a very effective way to do that. So, we’re growing quickly and I think we’re helping to grow this market.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations. I was wondering you talked about before improved targeting and relevance of newsfeed ads that lies ahead. I was just wondering if you could share with us the progress you think you’ve made on this initiative and kind of what is to come?\nSheryl Sandberg: Targeting is really important, because what takes an ad and makes it a good ad is whether it's relevant to you. When I see something on Facebook or anywhere that I’m interested in that’s a great experience. When I see something that I’m not interested in, that’s not -- and so we have done a lot of work around targeting. The most important work we've done over the past year and I think you're seeing its results and it is around Custom Audiences, which enables people to use their data in a privacy protective way with us. It enables them to show different ads to people who are current customers versus new customers who are interested in different things. And I think we're really pleased with the adoption. The number of marketers using Custom Audiences more than doubled in Q2 and we're now up to 50 of the AdAge 100 who have already started using the products. We also think there is room to improve. We can do more and we will continue to do more to improve the targeting, the relevance of our ads.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about thoughts on monetization of Instagram and maybe just potentially how you think about the ability to monetize that versus your core Facebook asset? And then secondly, Sheryl, could you talk about on the vertical basis where you think the biggest wide space opportunities are for advertising revenue for Facebook and the particular industries that you look at that they are materially underrepresented on Facebook where you could have the greatest growth going forward? Thanks a lot.\nMark Zuckerberg: Sure. I'll answer the Instagram question. Kevin has always been clear that we're building Instagram to be at business and that we expect that over time we're going to generate a lot of profit from it and probably through advertising. Now that all said, right now it's just growing still quickly. I mean the number that we just said was 130 million monthly actives. Video product is growing really quickly. There are so many directions to expand this in that we think that the right focus for now is to continue just focusing on increasing the footprint of Instagram. And when the right time comes then we'll think about doing advertising as well, but I think that's going to be a really big opportunity.\nSheryl Sandberg: In terms of growth opportunities, I think in terms of vertical categories, we have big growth opportunities across the board. There are certainly verticals that were stronger than others which were very strong, for example in CPG. But even though we've grown spend significantly, we're still a tiny portion of the spent that CPG advertises. And even in the verticals where I think we've done very well, starting to penetrate, there's a lot of room for growth. I think as you think about different industries using the power of online marketing, we see different levels of adoption but I'm a believer that over time this is where people are spending their time and any marketer who's trying to reach people is going to spend their resources there as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nJordan Rohan: Thanks so much. I think it's fairly easy too when talking to advertisers to access that there has been this latent demand for advertising on Facebook. But when you look across the globe, it's a little bit harder to address the advertising community. Can you talk about the growth of the ad sales force and the ad ops and all the people required to really bring that outside of the major U.S. and Western European markets? And specifically is there a chance that you believe that Asia-Pacific and rest of world markets can see a meaningful continued and sustainable shift higher in ARPU than where we are today? Thank you.\nSheryl Sandberg: Yes, I'm a big believer that revenue opportunities exist all over the world and our gross was very strong across regions, including outside of the U.S. for this time. We're up to over 40 offices and we have sales teams on the ground in over 40 offices and we're seeing really good adoption and really good growth across. You mentioned Asia, I was actually in Japan and Korea meeting with advertisers just a few weeks ago and we are seeing companies that really weren't doing much with us a year ago increasingly adopt us as part of a core part of their spend. So I remain very optimistic about our growth across Asia and the rest of the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. Two questions please. Can you talk about the mix of growth in direct selling versus programmatic selling for you guys and where do you see that going forward? And in terms of just on the cost side, I guess looking at the investment and by the way David, thanks for the color about operating expenses and guidance for the second half, but as you look at longer term, how far can you see that 50% increase in operating expenses still being sustained as you, I guess just looking at 2014? I know you're not guiding to 2014 right now, but just as we look at the model going forward how far do you think you can sustain growth in operating expenses faster than growth in revenues? Thank you.\nDavid Ebersman: Yeah, thanks for your question. Your first question about direct selling versus programmatic, the mechanism that most people buy from Facebook is through the option that we offer, but that doesn't mean that we're not – we don't have a sales force that's out calling on clients. Sheryl can expand on that if you want.\nSheryl Sandberg: Yeah, we sell both directly to our sales team so it's in-person and online. And what I think you mean by programmatic which is through third party such as DSPs and other – one thing worth noting is that FBX which is part of that programmatic selling is actually a very small part of our business and I think sometimes people don't understand that. So that piece is quite small. We are expanding both our direct selling efforts both to sales teams and online as well as the third parties we work with, and we think having a healthy and growing ecosystem on both sides is really good for the development of our business.\nDavid Ebersman: You asked about investments looking forward to next year, I think philosophically is the easiest way to answer that which is we still think we're early in the journey of building the service that we want Facebook to be and there's lots of work ahead of us to do and lots of things to do. And our plan will continue to be to invest aggressively in the areas that we think are important to improve our strategic positioning and to drive our ability to grow revenues and profits over the long run. We also know that to be the great company that we want to be, we have to be disciplined in everything that we do and focus our spend on the areas that are really most important. So, the challenge for us just by any company is finding that right balance. I really can't comment on 2014 yet honestly just because we haven't – I don't know what 2014 is going to look like. We tend to plan in six-month blocks and I think have our act together pretty well for what we're going to try to do in the second half of this year, but haven't been on the conversation about next year yet.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anthony Diclemente with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Diclemente: Thanks a lot. I have one for Sheryl and one for David. Sheryl, I'd be interested in hearing a little bit about the relative progress of impression-based selling versus performance-based and you mentioned the ecommerce – the doubling from ecommerce from direct response and I guess I just wanted to know if you've increased the amount of inventory that you're selling on an impression basis versus performance? And then David, I had a follow-up on the CapEx. It just seems like an interesting time for CapEx to be coming in when video usage and video uploads could be growing…\nSheryl Sandberg: We may have lost the question, but I'll take the first half while we wait for the second piece to come back. On the first piece, our system works that you can buy by CPM or CPC and we let advertisers choose. I think both parts of our business are healthy and growing. I think when people talk about impression-based purchasing or buying, what they're really trying to get at is brands. And brand is a very important, one of our four segments and one that's growing. When you think about what brand spenders are doing, they're trying to get discovery. And I think we've made a lot of progress there. We now work with every one of the global AdAge 100 over the past year. Now that said, people are in different parts of that spectrum. We have brand advertisers who are looking for discovery who have advertised with us for a long time, proven the value and are really expanding and these others that are newer, that are experimenting that aren't as convinced yet and it's our job to get there and convince them. I think what people are increasingly seeing is we have a big brand opportunity. We have a massive engaged audience, 88 million to 100 million people in the U.S. during primetime hours who are on Facebook. We offer discovery and we have a unique opportunity to take people all the way through the funnel. In one example, a recent one that I really like is T-Mobile did an ad campaign with us to attract people to sell new phones. They used our offer ads to do it. 9% of the people who claimed the offer converted to T-Mobile within 10 days and they had over 20 times return on their ad spend which is just incredibly strong in the industry and I think that shows the power of what we can do with impressions, taking people all the way through the funnel.\nDavid Ebersman: Anthony, I'll try and answer your question about CapEx as best I could. You got cut off as you probably know, so I only got about – well, I don't know how much of it I got but I got enough to give it a shot. And really the best way I can think to answer it is to describe for you the variables that influence what CapEx requirements are for the company. So clearly the number of users is near the top of the list, and also the time at which the users use the service. So adding users who are off peak -- the Facebook peak provides less of a burden for our infrastructure than people who are using at the same time as our peak hours, because we can leverage what we built to peak. A second thing is definitely the level of engagement with those users and that seem to be where you were going with your question about video. That is and will continue to be, we hope something that drives up requirements for our infrastructure because it means people are really engaging and finding new ways to use the service. What has helped us I think is the two variables that come next. One is just the cost of the equipment itself and the datacenters and over time Moore’s Law and other things and competition in the market have helped us to really be able to bring down the cost for each unit of equipment we use. And then the next variable which I mentioned in my remarks which I think is a really important one is just the efficiency of what we build. So over time I think Facebook has impressively succeeded at making the hardware we use more efficient and the software that we run on it more efficient in terms of how much compute power that is needs. The last variable of course probably the hardest to predict is product development, is just what we build and how that influences what the computer requirements are. So clearly the variable you emphasized which was engaging with higher content things is one of the things that will influence the CapEx over time, but it's a pretty complicated equation, but I think right now we’re managing well. I think we’re pleased with how 2013 is coming together in that regard.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Thank you. As we look back since mobile ramp back in 3Q last year, it's been pretty lumpy and it bounced around quarter-over-quarter, but it looks like a pretty big inflection this quarter. Can you help us understand why it has been so lumpy, at least we can think about going forward and maybe what caused the inflection this quarter? And then, I really appreciated the Time Spent metric, I think you said 20 billion minutes per day, but can you tell us how that compares to say a quarter ago or a year ago? Thank you.\nDavid Ebersman: So in terms of the progression of mobile, and we’re really pleased overall that on newsfeed ads in general and on mobile in particular are working so well in terms of the performance they’re providing to marketers and how users are engaging with them. For a new product like this, I don’t think we should be that surprised at the sort of quarter-to-quarter progression it's going to be harder to predict than it would be for a more mature product. I think one of the things that happened in the second quarter is that as the investments we’ve made started to really come together. We had a lot more demand in our system that met the quality bar that we set for feed, so we’re able to place that demand intelligently in a manner where it performed well and didn’t have a meaningful impact on the user experience. So I think that more feed eligible demand was a big part of the story. And I think one of the really good pieces of news for us is how well the price held up as we did that, as we increased the number of ads we showed in feed. So for many of our ads as you know marketers are bidding for clicks in an auction and the auction determines the price for supply both demand, the cost per click price. And in the second quarter and this specific, I’m going to give you is relative to the first quarter of this year because it's hard to do a year-over-year for mobile and for newsfeed because it just didn’t really didn’t exit a year-ago. Q2 relative to Q1, the number of clicks in our system went up a lot and we might have assumed that price would decline as click number increased because we’re basically pushing out the supply curve and changing the point where supply would meet demand. And that’s not what happened. Cost per clicks for feed ads increased and really demonstrating to us that demand was growing rapidly as well as we’re increasing the supply of ads we were showing. So it's not a perfect comparison because Q2 is seasonally stronger than Q1, but it's -- I don’t think the seasonality explains the agenda I just provided. And I think that’s a really encouraging metric for us. And your second question was …\nJustin Post: Time spent.\nDavid Ebersman: Time Spent. We just -- unfortunately we don’t have a lot of longitudinal data for Time Spent. It's not something that we had instrumented well going back more deeply in time because it's hard -- well it's hard on every interface and it's particular hard on mobile. We feel pretty good about where we are now in terms of the quality of the instrumentation. It is up on a per user basis. As you would imagine it's not -- it's gone quarter-over-quarter sequentially on a per user basis, it will be growing slowly. On an aggregate basis of course it's benefited from the fact that we have such a nice and consistent increase in the number of daily users of this service.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Great, thanks guys. David, just the continuation of what you were just talking about, so on the mobile newsfeed ads is the 5% number -- your 5% of stories being at the right number and is that consistent across geo’s. And then is the growth a function of, you just said price is going up sequentially obviously your mobile DAUs are going up or MAUs are going to up sequentially, then you’re probably also seeing improving click through rates. So, of those three variables, users, click through rate and price, which is driving the sequential increase the most in mobile? Thanks.\nDavid Ebersman: So in terms of the 5% number again, what we know is where we are now, and we’re pleased that things are going as well as they are at the current level. So, the number was zero a year ago, it increased steadily over the past year and the 5% number is a average number globally, it does differ by geography and it also differs by person. It will be higher for people for whom we have a lot of more ads that are targeted towards them and are relevant for them, and what we’re trying to do is find the right balance ideally for each user where we’re balancing their experience with Facebook and the performance of the ads and continually tweaking the product, learning from our experience to try and do that as well as we can. Going forward, I think as we have -- I think I’m consistent in saying the biggest opportunity for us is to improve the quality of the ads so that we can show ads that are engaging in relevant for the users involved. Your question about what drove the increase? I think everything contributed. I think that’s one of the things that’s encouraging about where we're, is we do have more users. We have more demand that enabled us to share more newsfeed ads. We’re really pleased with how click through had held up, and I mentioned what was happening in terms of cost per click increasing sequentially. So it's a nice balance contribution from the variables that determine what our revenue performance is.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you, I wonder if you could give us a sense for what the major hurdles are to overcome before deploying a major video ad product on the core site. As you’re out talking to potential clients, can you help us understand what demand looks like for that product. And then maybe separately just a sense for what you’re seeing in Europe from a macro perspective just given some of the mixed news we heard on the economy over there? Thanks so much.\nSheryl Sandberg: On Video ads, we have a current video ad product, because marketers can embed a video in a page post and we see a lot of marketers using that product and seeing good results as a demand to do more in video on Facebook is there. And we’re exploring how we can expand that, but we don’t have anything new to announce today. In terms of Europe, we heard the same things and obviously on the macro environment, but our growth has been very strong. We had a new Head of our European Operations as well. Nicola Mendelsohn who just started, we’re excited to have her and we’re experiencing a strong growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nBen Schachter: Congratulations on a really outstanding quarter. Mark I want to ask about the platform strategy and its broadly, how was the strategic vision to allow third-parties to provide services to the network evolved over the past year, and what needs to happen that more of a contribution from non-advertising based businesses?. And David just quickly from modeling, the mobile ad revenue, can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter, did it exit June much stronger than it was earlier in the quarter? Thanks.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, I mean, I can get the platform question. The strategy for that has – we shifted a bit to focus on building more business tools for developers than a lot of work we’re seeing is folks have shifted towards using products like mobile app installs and originally we were – we had a little bit of skepticism about how happy developers would be with a system where they would pay to get more distribution. But what we’ve actually found is that the NBS is really high for this, because it’s just more stable than anything else that they’ve had. In the past it’s the most stable way that they have to grow their app. So we’re basically focused on doing now is – we think about advertisers in terms of these used cases that folks had on this local businesses. They are great brands. They are developers, who are building app, there is an eCommerce and we’re really focused on building up the platform to be one of those big verticals to be a big part of the business. There is also a games part of the platform, which is kind of the first piece of platform that we launched and that is just continuing to grow at a slower, but steady rate.\nDavid Ebersman: Your second question was about progress through the quarter, nothing notable to report there. It was really a strong quarter from the beginning to the end.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nScott Devitt: Thanks. I had a bigger picture question for Mark. I was hoping you could give sort of a scorecard when you're in relative to your founder letter. I know it's been only 14 months and that's a short period of time, but it will be interesting to hear your views on the company's performance against the longer term aspirations and core values that you've put in the letter? Thanks.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, I think we're early. And one of the interesting things over the past six months or so is reaching 1 billion people was this big rallying cry for the company for a long period of time. And I think as we've passed that, we've seen the ambition that the company has grow. And reaching 1 billion users was a great first thing to focus on because no one had ever built a service that had 1 billion active people who were signed in and had real identity before. But in a way it's actually kind of just an abstract, there's nothing magical about 1 billion. The real goal is to connect everyone in the world and help people map out everything that there is. Well, I think what we're seeing is as some of the products succeed is just the ambition increased to be able to do more of these and taking on more longer term things. At the same time, I think what you have is we weren't happy with the quality of our mobile experiences, rewinding 18 months. So we had just a lot of foundational work to do and I think coming into this year, we kind of could tell internally that we were turning a corner on that. We were in good shape and could start to play a bit more offense. But as I think the numbers from this quarter suggest, I think we're really starting to see the upside of some of the investments that we've been making over the last period.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMark May: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. One of the things that stood out in your prepared remarks is I think you mentioned 40% year-on-year increase in average price per ad in North America in Q2. I was hoping you could remind us how that compared to say Q1 and given that I think you contributed that to higher performing ads, if maybe you could call out specifically what one or two either ad units or ad targeting enhancements were the kind of key contributors to that growth? And then secondly, David, I think you called out the more challenging comps as you enter into the second half of the year. Are you suggesting that it's kind of unreasonable for us to look at the sequential growth that you saw in the second half of 2012 and assume that that sort of rate of growth is repeatable this year?\nDavid Ebersman: Okay. In terms of pricing I think – we were pleased with the pricing growth in the first quarter too. The net across the world was a 3% average in the first quarter but that was much higher in the U.S. and Canada, because again for the same reason it wasn't impacted by the price floor change. So it was about 25% in the U.S. and Canada and was even stronger in the second quarter. And similarly in other territories, I think pricing is just going really well and would be stronger than the result show if not for the impact of the price floor. We probably have numbers that are similar to the U.S. and Canada, if not stronger in our other regions as well. In terms of the comps, I don't think there is anything particularly complicated so what I was saying, it's just if you're looking at the percentage growth rates for Q2, you're comparing to a quarter last year that really didn't have much mobile revenue or News Feed revenue in it at all and that really started to ramp up in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So it's there in one side of the comparison going forward.\nSheryl Sandberg: In terms of where the growth is coming from in terms of ad units, in terms of our market segments direct response marketers are a very big contributor to the growth. That's why I started with them in the remarks and in the Q\u0026A. Ecommerce doubled year-over-year and they're doing that by using a bunch of our different ad products; everything from post to offers to other things, but it's really about looking for those contributions. We've also seen a lot of growth, as I said, in mobile app install ads; small market but growing rapidly and it's a market where we offer a product that there is almost nowhere else to get the kind of returns and opportunity we offer.\nDavid Ebersman: I'm just going to add one more thing just in case I, in anyway, created any confusion and I have no evidence that I did yet. But the price per ad that I was talking about in this question reflects not the same thing as the cost-per-clicks that I answered in a question earlier because price per ad will also incorporate the click-through rate as well as the cost-per-click for click-based ad and also includes ads that are purchased on an impression basis. So most of the pricing metrics we provide are per ad inclusive of click-through rates and impression-based ads. The CPC metric I gave earlier was just, I think, a specific and useful metric in understanding how much strong demand contributed in the second quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.\nKenneth Sena: Hi. So just maybe if we could drill into the comment around ecommerce spending doubling and it seems as though FBX and third party effort, its growing fast but its small and the same with the app install effort. But can you talk a little bit about what drove that doubling in Europe year-on-year? Thanks.\nSheryl Sandberg: I think direct response marketers have had more opportunities to use our system, use our product and we've also made a very major investment in helping them measure returns and helping them connect what's happening both online and as well as throughout the system. So direct response marketers tend to be buyers when they have an ROI metric. They're looking for that ROI metric and their budgets are flexible around those ROIs. So as they've invested with us and hit their ROI metrics, their budgets go up and they make those adjustments very quickly. That's why when they start using the products and see the value they create, they are able to grow very quickly even within a quarter or within a week or within a month because they adjusted their budgets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rory Maher with Hillside Partners. Your line is open.\nRory Maher: Thanks. A couple of quick questions. First on hiring, there's been a lot of discussion in the press about tech companies' need for more highly skilled workers and I'm curious if you're feeling pressure to find that kind of highly skilled talent and what areas you find hardest to fill and maybe some successfully that you're finding good engineering talent? And then secondly on the advertiser mix, have you guys discussed your mix of brand advertisers by category like auto, retail, telecom, that kind of category mix? And are there any that have grown particularly well the past year?\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah, I can take this. Hiring great people especially engineers is one of the biggest challenges that any technology company has. We're doing really well against the hiring goals that we have. But I mean there was a systemic issue where our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would want to hire. And I think that that's a lot of what you hear these companies talking about. We're doing really well competitively right now. We have a really strong program on colleges where we can continue to attract a lot of best people who are graduating. We do really well at hiring senior engineers from across the valley as well. But it's just something that we invest a huge amount of time and it's really important.\nSheryl Sandberg: In terms of where we're growing by category; I've mentioned CPG, gaming, retail, these are vertical categories where we're strong. But again we're growing. We're growing; we're watching people really experiment. One of the things that's been really fun to see even though it's not a pay product is GE is Instagram work. GE is doing super interesting photos on Instagram which show us that other industries are also going to adapt to the social environment and to some of the new ways to reach customers globally.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham \u0026 Company. Your line is open.\nLaura Martin: Hi, there. Great numbers, you guys. Congratulations. Two questions. One on, could you guys clarify the custom advertising bucket? I know you said it was up 100% year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter and a lot of the brands are talking about this as a key growth area. So I'm really interested in how big it's starting for you guys? And then my second question is we're also talking to a lot of companies that target your metrics using UTI integrations and would that create an arbitrage I'm wondering if over time you foresee that being a stable ecosystem or are you guys going to try to ease those guys out over time and grab some of that upside that these arbitragers that are using our platform are garnering today? Thanks.\nSheryl Sandberg: On the first, Custom Audiences is small but growing and important. We doubled what I said as we doubled the number of marketers using the product Q2 over Q1, and that also has included getting us to 50 of the AdAge 100. As I've talked about as a large brand advertisers the AdAge from 100 have a long sales cycle and it takes a lot of work that happened to adapt products and so seeing adoption this quickly of something, we think shows how powerful that targeting is. In terms of some of the more programmatic ways people buy, we think it’s really healthy for us to have multiple sales channels. We like having a direct sales channel, which we have in our 40 – over 40 offices. We like having online and robust sales, because that means that even in countries where we’ve done half offices, we have the ability to sell into those markets. We also like having an eager system of what we call PMDs, third-party sellers who can work with our clients to provide some of the kind of features that we don’t have or some of the kind of capability that they may not have in house. And so for us, we’d like to see all of our sales channels continue to grow and thrive.\nDeborah Crawford: Operator, I think we’ve time for one last question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the numbers. Mark, longer term question focused on your initial comments, how have some of the recent products that are consumer facing that you guys have launched like Graph Search and Facebook Home sort of taught you what the consumer acceptance is for certain things, learnings about how the platform can be developed and evolved over time, would love to get your takeaways on that?\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah. Well, I mean I think that there are bunch of different kinds of products that you can ship. I mean everyday we ship a lot of tweaks to the products, or small changes to existing products. Then there are going be to products like Instagram video, which is really doing well and it fits very naturally into the current flow of how people use Instagram to capture moments that they’re proud of. So that makes sense. I think the team did a really good job there. The thing is like Home and Graph Search are really new used cases. I mean in the case of Home, it’s a new category of product that’s different from anything that exist out there and I think of its more a seed that we’re planting that its going to create completely new pillar of the ecosystem rather than drafting off behavior that people already have in the system today. So, I definitely think that we just have to look at this over the long-term. And it’s very – when we’re building models for the Company and we basically think that it’s going to be something that we will invest in for years. And we expect these to become marketing – market leading products and they’re doing things that no-one else really has, the strategic position or content to be able to build these products. So we’re excited about them. There is going to be longer term back. So I think if you wan to look at the different things that we’re doing in terms of how naturally they fit into the flow of a person’s day to day life today to get a sense of how quickly it’s going to ramp up over time.\nDeborah Crawford: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the M\u0026T Bank's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Don MacLeod, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDonald J. MacLeod: Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. This is Don MacLeod. I’d like to thank, everyone, for participating in M\u0026T's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link. Also before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking statements relating to the banking industry and to M\u0026T Bank Corporation. M\u0026T encourages participants to refer to our SEC filings, including those found on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements. Now I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, René Jones.\nRené F. Jones: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As I noted in the press release, our earnings quality remained strong in the recent quarter, including higher net interest income, comparatively strong mortgage banking revenues and above average credit quality. We took advantage of favorable market conditions by executing prudent balance sheet actions that enhanced our liquidity, capital and long-term return profile, while continuing to serve the needs of our communities in a relatively competitive landscape and an evolving regulatory environment. Let's review the detail of the quarter's results. After which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions. Turning to the specific numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per share, common share were $2.55 in the second quarter of 2013, up 29% from $1.98 in this year's first quarter and up 49% from $1.71 in last year's second quarter. Net income for the recent quarter was $348 million, up from $274 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $233 million in the second quarter of 2012. During the quarter, we took advantage of some -- of the stronger risk appetite from investors in the current low interest rate environment by selling over $1 billion of private label mortgage-backed securities previously held in our available-for-sale investment portfolio. The after-tax loss on the sale amounted to $28 million or $0.22 per common share. This transaction resulted in higher liquidity and capital and removed a risk-sensitive asset, which had been generating substantially all of our other-than-temporary impairment charges, from our balance sheet, and assists us in preparation for entering the 2014 CCAR process. Also during the quarter, we sold our holdings of Visa and MasterCard common stock, which we had received through the restructuring of those companies back before the financial crisis. The after-tax gain amounted to $62 million or $0.48 per common share. Lastly, following the second anniversary of the Wilmington Trust merger, we reversed an accrual for a contingent compensation obligation assumed in that transaction. The result is a reduction of noninterest expense, having an after-tax impact of $15 million or $0.12 per common share. Taken together, these 3 items contributed $50 million to net income for the quarter or $0.38 per common share. Since 1998, M\u0026T has consistently provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions. Included in GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were after-tax, merger-related expenses related to Hudson City that were incurred early in the quarter and which amounted to $5 million or $0.04 per common share. This compares with $3 million or $0.02 per share in the prior quarter. After-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets was $8 million or $0.06 per common share, unchanged from the prior quarter. Net operating income for the quarter, which excludes those merger-related expenses and intangible amortization, was $361 million compared with $285 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.65 for the recent quarter, up 29% from $2.06 in the linked quarter. Net operating income, expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity, was 1.81% and 22.72% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.48% and 18.71% in the first quarter of 2013. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning press release -- this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Tax equivalent net interest income was $684 million for the second quarter of 2013, up from $663 million in the linked quarter. As required by GAAP, we regularly revisit the cash flow projections on which we base our valuations of acquired loans. In general, continued improvement in economic conditions, particularly in the former Wilmington Trust footprint, led to a reduction in estimated expected credit losses on acquired loans of $130 million. As a result, our estimates of cash flows to be generated by the acquired loans have increased by about 2%. Those increases resulted in about $6 million of additional interest income in the second quarter on our $4.9 billion portfolio of acquired loans as compared to the first quarter. Of course, as acquired loans repay, and that portfolio reduces in size in future periods, the dollar amount of interest income earned on acquired loans will also decline. Net interest margin was 3.71% during the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter. A higher level of accretable yield from acquired loans added about 6 basis points to the margin compared to the first quarter. Prepayment penalties from commercial loans, combined with cash basis interest received on nonaccrual loans, added about 7 basis points to the margin as compared with the prior quarter, and higher level of excess funds held at the fed reduced the margin by about 9 basis points. This reflected a higher level of deposits by Wilmington Trust -- held by Wilmington Trust customers in connection with the pending -- in connection with pending capital markets transactions, as well as proceeds from the private-label MBS and the Visa and MasterCard stock that we sold. Lastly, in line with our prior outlook, there were some 4 basis points of what we'd consider core margin compression, which reflects the continuation of the trends that we, in the industry, have been seeing, higher-yielding loans maturing and being replaced at today's lower yields. As for the balance sheet, the average loans grew at an annualized 1% from the first quarter. Compared with 2013's first quarter, changes in average balance -- in average loans by category were as follows: Commercial and industrial loans grew a healthy 9% annualized; commercial real estate loans grew an annualized 2%; residential real estate loans declined an annualized 12%, reflecting in part our conversion of $288 million of FHA loans into Ginnie Mae securities, the majority of which were retained in our investment portfolio; consumer loans were down an annualized 2%. On an end-of-period basis, both commercial and industrial loans, as well as CRE loans, grew at a similar pace to what we experienced on an average basis for the quarter. From a regional perspective, the Upstate and Western New York region, as well as Pennsylvania, experienced decent overall loan growth at 8% and 7% annualized, respectively. This included double-digit annualized growth in C\u0026I loans. While the benefit we've been seeing as a result of the HSBC divestitures locally is tailing off, I would tell you that there is still some lingering benefit, as customers who had not moved to M\u0026T in the initial period following the merger are now finding M\u0026T to be a good fit. Loans in our metro region, which includes New York City, were relatively unchanged, reflecting paydowns on several large CRE transactions that generated the prepayment penalties I referenced earlier. The Mid-Atlantic region was also flat, I think largely in connection with the fact that it's the region that we're seeing the most competition from banks, as well as from life insurance companies. Average core deposits, which excluded deposits received at M\u0026T's Cayman Island office and CDs greater than $2,000 -- $250,000, grew an annualized 12%, reflecting in part the trust-related deposits I mentioned earlier. Turning to net interest -- noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $509 million in the second quarter compared to $433 million in the prior quarter. Included in that figure is a $56 million of net securities gains, which includes losses on the sale of the private-label MBS and the gains from the sale of Visa and MasterCard stock that I previously noted. Noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses, was $452 million, improved from $443 million in the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues declined to $91 million in the recent quarter compared with $93 million in the prior quarter. Residential origination volumes declined by 2% from the first quarter, while residential gain on sale margins declined by 40 basis points. The bright spot was on the commercial side, where originations and gain on sale revenue nearly doubled from the first quarter, which masked the decline on the residential side. We'll update you on our outlook for mortgage banking revenues in a few moments. Fee income from deposit services provided were $112 million during the recent quarter compared with $111 million in the linked quarter. Trust and investment revenues were $125 million, up from $102 million in the prior -- excuse me, $125 million, up from $122 million in the prior quarter. Those revenues benefited from the normal seasonal uptick in tax preparation fees. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $578 million for the second quarter. Excluding the reversal of the accrual that I mentioned at the beginning of the call, operating expenses were $604 million. This compares to $618 million in the first quarter. The decline compared to the linked quarter reflects a return to normal levels of compensation expense, following the seasonally high levels in the first quarter, partially offset by higher professional service fees, including those related to our BSA/AML work. The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization and the merger-related gains and expenses, was 50.9% for the second quarter, improved from 55.9% in the prior quarter. Excluding the reversal of the Wilmington Trust accrual, the efficiency ratio would have been 53.2% in the second quarter. That efficiency ratio was also improved from 56.9% in the year-ago quarter. Next let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans were 1.46% of loans at the end of the second quarter, improved from 1.6% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter and 1.52% of total loans at the end of last year. Other nonperforming assets, consisting of assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans, also continued to decline, down from $96 million at the end of the first quarter to $82 million as of June 30. As has been the case for some time, we expect to report a further decline in our level of criticized assets when we file our 10-Q next month. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $57 million compared with $37 million in the first quarter. The increase was the result of a $30 million charge-off on a loan to a wholesaler and remanufacturer of auto parts. The annualized charge-off rate -- the annualized net charge-offs, as a percentage of total loans, were 35 basis points, in line with our long-term average. Annualized net charge-offs were 23 basis points in the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses was $57 million for the second quarter, exactly matching charge-offs. As a result, the allowance for credit losses was unchanged at $922 million at the end of the second quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41%, again, unchanged from the linked quarter. The allowance -- the loan-loss allowance as of June 30 was 4.9x the annualized net charge-offs for the annualized year-to-date net charge-off level. Loans 90 days past due, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value at acquisition, were $340 million at end of the recent quarter. Of these, $315 million or 93% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Loans 90 days past due were $331 million at the end of the first quarter, of which 94% were guaranteed by government-related entities. M\u0026T's Tier 1 common capital ratio was an estimated 8.55% at the end of June, up 62 basis points from 9 -- from 7.93% at end of the first quarter. With the adoption of the final rule on Basel III capital accord for U.S. bank holding companies, we are now working on formalizing our disclosure for this ratio and should begin ongoing reporting of this measure by the end of the third quarter. Our preliminary estimate is that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III will be 40 to 45 basis points lower than that under Basel I. This contrasts with our remarks on the January call, where we estimated that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III -- under the Basel III NPR will be lower by some 75 to 100 basis points than under Basel I. So another way, we estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III at the end of June would be approximately 8.1%. Lastly, let's turn to our outlook. The rising long-term interest rates during the quarter from historical low levels provide us with an opportunity to invest in higher-yielding, qualifying, liquid securities, and we continue to see the potential for the estimated 3 basis points of quarterly core margin pressure that we've previously indicated. The intense competition among lenders and other -- in our markets continues. Although at this point, our outlook for mid-single-digit loan growth for 2013 is unchanged. The tapering off in Residential Mortgage Banking activity that we referenced earlier this year has obviously begun and should lead to further declines in mortgage banking revenues and gain on sale margins during the second half of the year. Turning to expenses. While we expect our core expenses to continue to be well managed, we expect our professional service expenses to continue to rise, reflecting our continued investment in infrastructure, including risk management, as well as enhancements to our capital planning and stress testing. In addition, we are hiring staff to support those and other regulatory efforts. And with respect to credit. Despite the charge-off on the loan to the auto parts company this quarter, we expect net charge-offs to remain low for the remainder of 2013, which, as I've noted before, are already below what we consider to be our long-run -- long-term loss rate. As I've mentioned previously, we remain focused on enhancing our capital and liquidity profile and closing the gap with our peer regional banks as we transition towards becoming a CCAR bank in 2014. We continue to build a quality capital at a healthy pace, with our estimated Tier 1 common ratio at 8.55%, again, up 140 basis points from last June and 62 basis points from March. Lastly, I want to end by giving you an update on the BSA/AML matter that we disclosed in April. As you know, we subsequently entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve on June 18, which outlined our obligations to address the fed's concerns regarding BSA/AML compliance. The written agreement calls for submitting a plan in the near term, which would then need to be carried out to the satisfaction of our board and the fed. The satisfactory execution of that plan is a critical path towards a resolution of that written agreement. We are working diligently to address these matters in a timely and accurate manner. The successful resolution of which will result in a stronger risk management infrastructure at M\u0026T for years to come. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth: changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may materially -- which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. I know you all have been busy this morning with all of the earnings announcements in addition to ours. So now maybe we'll -- let's open up the call to questions. Before which, I'll have Jackie briefly review the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette \u0026 Woods.\nBrian Klock: I just want to make sure I get all the moving pieces here. So within the release, you guys talked about a $13 million impact to net interest income, which sounded to me maybe related to the $130 million you re-classed from the non-accretable. So that to me, I think is -- how does that kind of reconcile with the $6 million you talked about here this morning?\nRené F. Jones: Yes. You've got to think about -- we -- when we report, in our Q, the table on accretable yield, it's all of the yield on the acquired loans. So you have that number coming down from quarter-to-quarter, right? We added a new estimate of our cash flows that we're likely to receive. So really, when you look at the change from the quarter-to-quarter, that accretable yields from acquired loans, that actually increased by just $6 million, right, because the number is coming down over time.\nBrian Klock: Got you. So the $70.5 million you recorded in the first quarter, that number had gone down by $7 million, and now you added $6 million in. So...\nRené F. Jones: Yes. So I think that number is about $6.5 million higher than the last quarter, $70.5 million to $77 million or so.\nBrian Klock: I got you. Okay. And then -- so I guess going forward then, that $6 million -- I mean, I guess, if I had a run rate, that I was kind of assuming you'd have a level yield in that acquired portfolio that the accretable yield would go down, I should be adding somewhere about that $13 million impact to my -- what I would have guessed would have been your normal accretable yield going forward? Is that fair to say?\nRené F. Jones: Well, I think if you were to reset yourself, right, you can kind of look back at those tables we provided. You can see how much that is coming down. So for -- I won't give you the example, but you can kind of work your way through that. But the way I think about it, Brian, is we're left with about $4.9 million of acquired loans out of, say, 60 -- sorry, 6 -- $4.9 billion of acquired loans out of $60 billion. And if you look at the yield, the yield -- the difference between our yield on loans with versus without those acquired loans is about 15 basis points. And if you assume for a minute that the average life is 3 years, you're going to lose about 5 basis points of that every year, basis point or so a quarter. That's embedded in when Don and I talk about 3 basis points of compression. That's one of the things causing that compression. So your assumption of level yield is that's the way we look at it. That's the appropriate way to look at it, I think.\nBrian Klock: Okay. So x all of this, your guidance then of saying, \""Look, you should be back to sort of the 3 to 4 basis points of core compression.\"" That is assuming though that you take, what, about $2 billion or so -- $2.4 billion of interest-bearing deposits, that excess liquidity, which was the 9 basis point drag this quarter on the NIM. You are going to put that back to work, either you're going to buy some securities or actually put that in organic loan growth?\nRené F. Jones: Yes. Well, I mean, how do I -- good question. So what I would say is you got it right. So we're -- our thought process is 3 basis points of compression a quarter. We're still sticking with that. One of the things that we do have is we do have the opportunity to reinvest that cash in sort of qualifying liquid securities, as you start thinking about the new ratios that are coming out. So that gives us some ability to offset. And I don't know how to exactly think about that because as you know, we often think about match funded. So as we put on Ginnie Maes and those types of things, economically, we think about the spread towards wholesale funding that we could go out and get. But you're right, one of the sources that could in the near term have the margin be more stable is reinvesting those -- that cash.\nBrian Klock: Okay. And then, I'm going to get in the queue. But just with that, you haven't reinvested that excess liquidity yet?\nRené F. Jones: We've invested some. So if you look at the investment securities portfolio, you've got -- so we sold the $1.1 billion of the agencies. That probably had an average impact of somewhere between $600 million and $700 million on the balance sheet. But we also purchased a little over $800 million of Ginnies. And if you think about what we've been saying, our investment securities book has been shrinking, in part because, and this is my term, the rate seemed to be a little artificial. And so with a jump-up of 100 basis points, it was sort of a nice opportunity for us to say, \""Okay. Well, let's start buying some, so that we can hold those qualifying securities as we go forward.\""\nBrian Klock: Okay. I guess, that agencies you bought, can you just give us that yield, and I'll -- then I'll get back in the queue.\nDonald J. MacLeod: The Ginnies we bought -- we committed to buy in 2Q, but they all settle in July. So they're not on the balance sheet at June 30.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.\nTodd L. Hagerman: René, couple of questions just in terms of the BSA issue, as well as Hudson City. First off, can you give us a sense of like the time line for the planned submission to the fed?\nRené F. Jones: Well, I mean, the only thing we really can give you is as you saw in the written agreement, there's a requirement, around 60 days, for us to come up with our credible plan that would need to be approved by the regulators. And then what's probably most important is from their reaction, we have to go execute that plan, right? So the way I think about it is we're really focused on submitting that plan, and then we'll have our head down for some time, trying to make sure that we have everything in place to execute it. So I think sort of speculating on any time line, at least right now, doesn't make much sense for us. We'll keep updating you as we move forward. But there's not really much to say beyond that at this point.\nTodd L. Hagerman: Okay. Is only just my assumption that you guys, obviously, had kind of started that work prior to formerly receiving the agreement based on what they had possibly communicated to you previously, as you guys disclosed that last quarter.\nRené F. Jones: Yes. I mean, that's true. I mean, I'll say 2 things: I feel that I'm happy, we got a good jumpstart on the issue. And in the same tone, I think we've got a lot of work to do. So I think the way we think about it is once you get into something like that, like everything else, you want to build a first-rate process, not one that just sort of meets the hurdle, but that you can sort of use as an investment for the long term. So I feel good, and at the same time, I also feel like we've got a lot of work to do.\nTodd L. Hagerman: Yes. No, understood. And then I don't know if you can answer this. But within the agreement, there's not necessarily any prohibition in terms of asset purchases and so on and so forth. But I think as you mentioned in your remarks, you want the plan and execution, so to speak, to be to the satisfaction of not only the fed, but the board as well. So help me kind of understand in terms of, again, kind of that process, if you will, from a formal standpoint and how it may affect or influence your ongoing kind of evaluation of the Hudson City transaction as I think about valuation in your ongoing review of that deal as time goes on.\nRené F. Jones: Well, you got a couple of questions in there. I think -- I mean, I think one, I'm going to repeat myself. I think once we get through the work we have to do on BSA/AML, and when we get through to the satisfaction of everybody, then we'll consider what we do with things such as Hudson City, but really not before then. In terms of the economics, I mean, we have a good understanding of Hudson City's balance sheet. We think about, for example, what the moves in rates will do to them. We -- there's a lot of moving parts, but there's nothing that makes us uncomfortable about the economics of the transaction relative to where we were before. Obviously, all of that's got to be revisited when we sort of get back at it, right?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth M. Usdin: Can you talk a little bit about the servicing acquisition that you guys are going to close, when is it going to close and how we think about the financial impact of it?\nRené F. Jones: Well, again, I think the first thing is, is that we're not purchasing servicing, right? We -- what we've agreed to do, that's been out there in the [indiscernible] public for some time is to be a sub-servicer, right? And so just sort of operationally, I mean, if you think about expenses for a minute, you're likely to see expenses rise on a normal basis. I talked about that earlier on my earlier comments. But we've now hired about 500 people located here in Buffalo that used to work for a third party. And all of those 500 people are up and running as of July 1, right? So first thing you're going to see is that there'll be a little bit higher expenses as you get into the third quarter, and then that work will trickle in through the quarter, right? And so I don't think you really get a full running impact of any change in our servicing profitability in probably till the fourth quarter, right? But I would say, it's kind of relatively negligible if you think of the bottom line because of the fact that you've got to sort of start up -- negligible next quarter because you've got to put those upfront costs in place.\nKenneth M. Usdin: I was getting more at what you think the incremental kicker is from a run rate perspective, not from a next quarter. But is this accretive to earnings? Is it -- I mean, the math would say it is. I'm just trying to give -- get a sense of if this -- is this a needle mover, is this just...\nRené F. Jones: I mean, it's a great question, Ken. I guess, the way -- I didn't think about it till you just said that. But I don't really -- it's not that big, such that it's going -- I mean, going to offset the decline that we're going to see in residential mortgage gains, and we saw a 40-point decline on the residential side there. I wouldn't be surprised to see the same again next quarter. I don't -- I think that's probably the bigger theme, maybe mortgage banking revenue will be a little bit supported over the next few quarters by it, but you're still going to see an overall downward trend.\nKenneth M. Usdin: Yes. And René, just the -- that reversal of the Wilmington gain, did -- could you just talk to us about the size of that and where that was geographically within the expense lines?\nRené F. Jones: Well, it's in other expense. And this was when we closed the merger at the outset of the opening balance sheet, there was contingency outstanding, obviously, because if you can take yourself back to all that turmoil, we wanted to make sure that we were properly reserved given all of the contracts that were sort of out there. And I think what you see is this very nice sign that as -- over time, we've kind of gotten through the integration. It's now a little past the 2-year anniversary. A lot of people have remained with M\u0026T and have decided to sort of remain as part of the group. So what you're kind of seeing is the finality of all that. And there was sort of that amount that was no longer considered a contingent liability as we got to this quarter. So I think I said the amount, did I not?\nDonald J. MacLeod: On a pretax basis, it was $26 million.\nKenneth M. Usdin: $26 million. Okay. And then last quick thing is just can you give us the mortgage apps pipeline closings?\nRené F. Jones: Oh, yes. So I'll give you a couple numbers. So this lock volume, I'll give you, the first quarter was $1.8 billion -- $1.9 billion. Second quarter was $1.8 billion. And then if I give you the pipeline, at the end of the first quarter, we have $1.6 billion. And the end of the second quarter, we have $1.6 billion. So what's happening is the volume is up, is remaining steady, maybe down 1 or 2 percentage points. But the only reason that's happening is because the gain on sale margins are dropping at a healthy pace. So I think that kind of tees you up. I wouldn't expect a big, big change in volume next quarter, but I would expect gain on sale margins to continue to decline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets.\nBob Ramsey: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how the movement that we've seen in mortgage rates and interest rates generally impacts the Hudson City acquisition. And I think that those assets get mark to market at close. So with mortgage rates higher, how does that affect, I guess, the capital gain, as well as the income off of that business?\nRené F. Jones: Okay. So I'm going to give you this very -- in a very general sense and from my understanding of, over the past year, the balance sheet, not necessarily from having any conversations with Hudson City. And I would guess, if I look at the profile of that balance sheet, the mortgages will extend some, net interest income will be higher. The issue you had is the steepening of the curve. So obviously, that's going to affect a little bit of the mark on any sort of fixed rate asset side, but you're going to have them out there for a longer period as well, right, so that's a little bit of an offset. And I wouldn't expect much in the way of any change in the mark on the liability side, right, because the short end didn't move. So you could get some -- if you're thinking of March, maybe there would be some negative impact as where we stand today. Really what matters most is what happens to the short end because that's where the big issue is on the wholesale borrowing. The second point I would make is that as we see things here, these are reflections of the economy improving. So you also should get some improvement on the credit profile. I mean, they're pristine. But having said that, everybody should get some benefit from the improvement in the economy. And the third thing is that the change in the Basel III rule is probably a positive effect from what we are all thinking on how mortgages are treated, both from the complexity of what we have to do to track it all and also from the favorable capital treatment from the rule now being finalized. So there's a lot of moving parts, right, but those are the items.\nBob Ramsey: Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question, and I'll hop back out. The bump in CRE loan yields this quarter -- I know you mentioned prepayment penalty income. I'm just curious how much of that was the prepayment? How much was maybe the adjustment in assumptions on the Wilmington purchase loans? And I didn't catch the prepayment dollar amount if you gave it earlier.\nRené F. Jones: Yes. I lumped it all together, and I think with the nonperformings, and we said that was 7 basis points, the 2 in total relative to the previous quarter. And I mean, without getting real -- I have it somewhere, probably half of that is probably prepayment. Give me a second. Yes, I don't have the 2 broken out, but let's say it's half of the 7 basis points, just as a general thought. I think the real issue, it's interesting, is that -- so when we sit around thinking about that we say, \""Okay, well maybe that won't reoccur next quarter.\"" So we tend to be relatively conservative. But having said that, it's very logical that we were seeing prepayment -- those prepayment penalties, because all throughout our balance sheet, we saw the impact of lower rates and people trying to refinance. We saw it in credit, in both deals, in our normal portfolio, where it actually was not a bad quarter in terms of loan volume in terms of origination. But we're seeing a lot of refinancings. We're seeing that in the nonperforming book. It's also part of what's behind the reversal on the Wilmington side of the -- into accretable yield, right? Because people are able to refinance things that are relatively healthy. So that said, it's hard to predict. It's somewhat lumpy in the margin, but it could continue, for while -- as people are trying to make sure they lock down their refinancings with the anticipation of rates being up.\nBob Ramsey: Okay. And the Wilmington credit market investment, was that predominantly in the commercial real estate portfolio? Is that where virtually all that was?\nRené F. Jones: It's across the board. There was a fair amount, a healthy amount in the real estate portfolio, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.\nErika Penala: Just a follow-up question on the liquidity. What -- of the $2.4 billion in average balances, especially in light of the Basel III requirements on liquidity, what -- how much should we consider excess to -- for reinvestment?\nRené F. Jones: So let me just -- I'll get to you -- I'll do it in 2 parts. So overall, our focus over the next couple of quarters is to sort of -- is to continue to improve our liquidity profile, and sort of the movement in rates makes that a little bit easier today. So as we get to the outset, would not be surprising to see all of that sort of reinvested in very, very liquid-type securities. But beyond that, we probably would continue to focus on that through additional -- we did $800 million of unsecured funding a quarter or 2 ago. We'll probably do more of that, right? So over time, we'll start to work on that liquidity profile as we get closer to the final rules. And then that will have to be also invested. So I'd kind of think of the first set as maybe all of the $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion will be invested. And then there'll be more, but it will -- those will be at sort of match-funded spreads, right?\nErika Penala: And just a second question on the follow-up to your expense guidance. Should we think of the base upon which we're growing expenses for the second half of the year as $604 million?\nRené F. Jones: I don't see anything wrong with doing that. I think yes, then you'll have to make adjustments for -- again, I mentioned the people we've hired and we continue to hire folks on the regulatory side. I think since last quarter, for example, we've hired 53 BSA/AML professionals, we've added to the team. And then you'll see professional services rising some as well, but starting at that $604 million is probably a good way to go about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Crédit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Just looking at overall loan growth here. I understand why you're reducing the consumer real estate portfolio at a pretty fast clip here. But I'm wondering, can you provide some commentary around your expectations for overall loan growth before the Hudson City deal closes, really given kind of modest negative loan growth in the first quarter and flattish loan growth during the second quarter.\nRené F. Jones: What was the first part? Modest negative growth when?\nCraig Siegenthaler: I was just saying -- well, I mean, the question is what are your expeditions for overall loan growth given residential real estate is kind of running off and commercial is actually fairly strong.\nRené F. Jones: Yes. So I don't know if you caught that, but we securitized some FHA loans. And so a little under $300 million of that just went right into our securities book. So in terms of earnings assets, there wasn't much of a change. There'll be a slight runoff in the resi portfolio, but we'll also do some -- retain a certain portion to sort of keep that runoff to be flat as we go forward. The C\u0026I, I mean, it was a little higher than normal, and I would say 9% growth is pretty healthy. We haven't seen a change. When we look at our pipeline for both C\u0026I and CRE, the quarter was pretty good. The amount of pressure on deals that we accepted was light. The margins were strong. The thing that we're seeing is that there's a fair amount of prepays, particularly on the fixed rate portfolios. And then finally, if you look at the consumer side on as that [ph] basis, and particularly if you look at home equity and indirect, for the first time, they actually had slight growth. So it sort of seems like those are leveling off, which is kind of why we held our -- held on to our 5% number overall. So we don't see much change. Some people are talking about slowdown. But everything we see is -- the slowdown is driven by paydowns, which is always good from a credit perspective, it's always good from the customer locking in lower rates and being healthier, right? So that's our logic behind sort of sticking with 5%, or mid-single digit, I think is what we -- or low mid-single-digit loan growth.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. And René, you classified about $10.4 billion of consumer real estate loans in the June quarter. I understand why that was down, but do you expect that portfolio to decline at a pretty quick pace the next few quarters? Or you think that should kind of level off here?\nRené F. Jones: It hasn't changed much. I mean, it's been down 1%, 2% every time we report. And on an asset basis, it was actually flat to up this quarter, right? So I kind of view it as slowing. I can't think of another reason why that would change.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And then, René, just a number question on the fee waiver. What was the impact of fee waivers in the second and first quarter in the trust income line? Was it material?\nRené F. Jones: Fee waivers.\nDonald J. MacLeod: On the money funds, I think I'll have to get back to you on that, Craig. I don't have that in hand right now.\nRené F. Jones: Well, finally to your last question, I think the other thing is, is that we may do more securitizations, right? So that will be just to re-class. But again, we want to make sure that the portions of our balance sheet that we have as customer loans, that we make sure that they have guarantees and a certain amount of liquidity as we kind of think about our liquidity coverage.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.\nKen A. Zerbe: René, at the beginning of the call, you mentioned that you -- part of the reason why you sold the securities was to help your 2014 CCAR application. Is -- has anything changed in terms of the application process? Are you -- is there a certain reason for why you're doing it? Because obviously, you went through the process last year. I was just wondering what's different about next year's process.\nRené F. Jones: That's a great question. It's a great, great question. Well, we went through the CapPR process, which is a process where we run our own models and we go through a review, and the Federal Reserve and other -- Federal Reserve actually goes through and reviews our governance and our process. But we've actually never been a CCAR bank, which requires an extra step, which is being part of the horizontal process, in which half is -- half of that process is what we did before, but the other half is that it now goes through the fed's own models, right, which was something that we're not familiar with. So we've really taken the position that as we kind of have learned about our portfolio, we thought -- we want to make sure that we're pretty well positioned to go through that test for the first time. And of course, that sort of is all benchmarked off of where you are at 9 30. So it's been a big focus of ours. Well that married up very nicely, with the private label mortgage-backed securities is that we run a model and we've modeled those for valuation purposes. And until recently, our model was saying that those securities were worth more than what the market prices were implying. But as we got into the early part of the quarter, that changed, and the valuations on the market were well above our model. And so we decided to pull the trigger. To give you some sense, had we pulled that trigger back in '09, the difference would have been roughly $240 million, right? So it's not a core security. It's also a risk-sensitive security. So if you have stress and housing prices were to drop, right, then not only are you not going to collect that $200 million extra, you're going to take a hit, right, in OTTI under extreme stress. So it's not a core asset. We decided to move it off, and then we take the $1 billion, and we also use it to improve our liquidity profile.\nKen A. Zerbe: All right. That helps. And then just really quickly, or last thing is on the CRE payouts you mentioned, there was a couple of big ones in the quarter that drove the prepays. Was that -- how large were they? I'm just trying to get a sense of if it was meaningful for the growth in CRE this quarter.\nRené F. Jones: Yes. It would have changed the percentage growth. I definitely think so. I don't know how to -- I mean, first of all, there were several. Several loans, anywhere from $5 million to $30 million, $35 million would not be abnormal. And not only that, in our nonaccrual book, you had several loans that paid off as well, right, so both there and the nonaccrual balances. So how do I say it? I think -- I kind of think of it as more of a trend. I don't know how long the trend will last. But I don't know if that helps. There was not one really large transaction that paid down [ph].\nOperator: And that was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nDonald J. MacLeod: Again, thank you, all, for participating today. And as always, if clarification of any of the items on the call or news release is necessary, please contact our Investor Relations Department at area code (716) 842-5138.\nOperator: Thank you.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?\nThomas M. Prescott: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'd like to personally welcome, David White, our new CFO, to Align. I'm excited to have him join our executive team. For those of you that haven't met David yet, he started the 1st week of August just after we reported Q2 results. He's hit the ground running and he's quickly coming up to speed in our business. On the call today, I'll provide some highlights from our third quarter results and briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Invisalign Clear Aligners and iTero scanner and CAD/CAM services, including some color on our customer channels and geographies. David will share more detail on our Q3 financials, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions. I'm pleased to report another very good quarter for Align, with revenue, gross margin and EPS higher than our outlook. Further, we achieved record levels of revenue, Invisalign case volume and North America iTero scanner volume, enabling us to reach the low end of our long-term model for our operating margin, while generating strong operating cash flow. The third quarter includes the seasonally slower period in Europe and North America for our GP dentists, along with the peak of the summer season for teenage orthodontic case starts. We're pleased that patient traffic appears to have remained solid for our North American ortho customers this summer, which resulted in strong sequential and year-over-year growth for Invisalign volume, especially in the important teenage patient segment. For Q3, total Invisalign case shipments increased to nearly 107,000 cases worldwide for the first time. Year-over-year growth was driven by continued expansion of our customer base, as well as increased Invisalign utilization. Improvements in product and technology over the past few years, including our new SmartTrack Aligner Material, are helping build even greater clinical confidence so our doctors will utilize Invisalign more often and on more complex cases. Doctors continue to give SmartTrack Aligner Material high marks on performance, with 78% of doctors surveyed agreeing that SmartTrack supports better clinical outcomes. SmartTrack Aligner Material also recently received the Top 100 Product accolades from Dentistry Today as the winner of the 2013 Pride best-in-class award, which will be presented at the upcoming ADA meeting in New Orleans in 2 weeks. Future results also reflect solid growth from iTero scanner and CAD/CAM services business. I'll start with a quick recap of a few key metrics for Invisalign, covering utilization, training and teenage ortho market penetration. But rather than going to a lot of detail here, I recommend that you reference our Q3 earnings slides posted on our website. For Q3, total Invisalign utilization was 4.3 cases per doctor, a slight decrease from Q2 at 4.4, which reflects an increase in utilization by North American orthodontists, offset by North American GPs and European doctors. This is consistent with the seasonally slower period for these customers and geographies. In Q3, we continue to expand our base of Invisalign providers, adding 90 North American orthodontists, 705 North American GP dentists and 840 international doctors for a total of 1,635 new Invisalign doctors. During the quarter, total teenagers treated with Invisalign increased to 28,900 and had a year-over-year increase of 18% and a sequential increase of 23%. For North American orthodontists, Q3 case volume of 41,600 cases increased 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting continued increases in utilization, along with some contribution from new orthodontist submitters. These results reflect our continued focus on driving adoption and utilization of Invisalign into the very important teenage orthodontic market. While we are still assessing the market data from the summer teen season, we believe we gained some teen share of overall orthodontic case starts. For North American GP dentists, Q3 Invisalign case volume of 38,500 cases increased 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting an expanding customer base, along with increased utilization. On a sequential basis, GP case volume was down slightly as expected given the seasonally slower summer period for most GP practices. For international doctors, Q3 Invisalign case volume of 26,800 cases increased 22% year-over-year and was down modestly from Q2 as expected, reflecting summer holidays for our customers, especially in the southern European countries. We continue to see strong volume growth for our Asia Pacific region, which was up sequentially and year-over-year. That strong volume growth in Asia-Pacific came from our traditional direct country markets of Japan and China, as well as our new direct country markets in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Collectively, this region continues to represent a great growth opportunity for Align. For Japan, Q3 was another record quarter for Invisalign volume. Strong growth was driven by the continued increase in the submitter base. We're also seeing positive trends in teen submissions, as a result of expanded training for Japanese doctors on the Invisalign teen product, which began in July. Product innovations like Invisalign G4 and SmartTrack really hit home in the market like Japan where the cases are very complex. For China, Q3 was also a record quarter, with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in Invisalign volume. These results reflect continued good execution of our strategic investments over the past few years. The China team continues to deliver outstanding clinical education, provide high-impact clinical and customer support and facilitate peer-to-peer advocacy, all of which support our strong progress. Much of this effort is being helped by key opinion leaders at the premiere government hospitals and orthodontic and dental schools. As the dental market evolves in China, access to dental care is expanding. Fueling part of that expansion is the increasing number of clinics serving the growing middle class. Align is now working closely with a number of these high-quality operators that are actively marketing Invisalign to consumers. These clinics understand the value of the Invisalign brand and are working to make Invisalign a significant part of their practice. On an overall basis, in our direct coverage Europe region, case shipments increased in this region by 20% year-over-year led by Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Across the region, we've seen an increase in clinical confidence in our product, along with further expansion of our customer base and increased demand for shorter, simpler treatments. These trends, combined with our continuous investment in education and customer experience improvements are contributing to great progress for Invisalign in Europe. All country markets demonstrated a strong year-over-year growth for Invisalign case shipments, with the exception of the U.K., which decreased slightly compared to Q3 last year. While our team in U.K. continues to work against some economic headwinds, we are seeing some initial signs of recovery among orthodontists in the UK. Turning to our consumer program, late in Q2, we launched a new fully-integrated consumer advertising campaign in North America and Q3 was the first full quarter in the market. The Better Smile Everyday campaign continues our focus on women and moms and teenagers and it's launch was timed to coincide with the busy teen orthodontic season, which runs from late spring to the start of the new school year. We're pleased with the strong early metrics from the campaign, which combines TV and digital advertising, with social media and traditional media relations. Web traffic at invisalign.com continues at an all-time high and that's a strong indicator of consumer awareness and interest in Invisalign. And as result of great editorial coverage in key outlets such as Lucky magazine, Marie Claire and Working Mother, our year-to-date print and online media impressions are at an all-time high. Over time, we expect to convert this awareness and interest into patient starts in our customers' practices. Let's now shift to our scanner and CAD/CAM services segment, where we had a record quarter for scanner shipments in North America. We're continuing to build our scanner installed base. And by our estimates, we are growing faster than our competitors. These results reflect the selling leverage we are gaining for major Invisalign customer events such as the Invisalign GP Summit held in July, as well as Invisalign orthodontic forums, a key clinical education event held throughout Q3. This progress and the feedback we continue to receive from iTero customers supports our belief that we have the best scanner with the greatest utility in the industry. An important part of our scanner business strategy is to improve the customer and patient Invisalign experience through the use of scanners to replace PVS impressions. We are definitely seeing leverage as our case submissions from digitally screened -- digitally scanned impressions continue to increase consistently. As of Q3, the percentage of Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scan rose to 25% in Q3 compared to 22% in Q2 and 13% in Q3 a year ago. Doctors, staff members and especially patients are all happy about this trend, as they see faster cycle times, better aligner fit and a far better experience. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to David for a review of our Q3 financial results. David?\nDavid L. White: Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the warm welcome. It's great to be here at Align on my first earning -- quarterly earnings call, especially after such great results. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that unless stated otherwise, all the financial information I'll discuss will be presented on a GAAP basis. Now with that, let's review our third quarter results. As Tom mentioned, our revenues for the third quarter amounted to $164.5 million, up slightly from the prior quarter and up 20.5% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Third quarter clear aligner revenue of $153.5 million was relatively flat sequentially and was up 21.2% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was driven primarily by seasonal strength in the North American Ortho market, which reflects a 27% sequential increase in number of teenage cases in North America. This was offset somewhat by a decrease in international cases and lower international ASPs. North America ASPs were flat. Our year-over-year growth reflected higher Invisalign volumes across all geographies, channels and products. Turning to our third quarter scanner and CAD/CAM services segment. Revenue was $11 million, half of which related to scanners and the balance of which related to services. This represented a 4.1% sequential increase and a 12.1% increase year-over-year. Third quarter scanner volume was up 32% over the last quarter, which reflected record volumes in North America. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses. Third quarter gross margin was 76.0%, up sequentially half of a point and up 2.4 points over a non-GAAP gross margin reported in the same quarter last year. Clear aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 79.9%. This was up 1.5 points sequentially and up 2.3 points when compared with gross margin reported in the same quarter last year. The sequential increase was a result of 2 primary factors: First, a more favorable product mix shift to higher-priced products; and secondly, as a result of updating our midcourse correction policy last quarter, we expensed a modest increase in mid-course correction cases and a corresponding reduction in our warranty claims. This necessitated a modest true-up of our revenue deferrals and warranty reserves, which actually resulted in a reduction in our overall gross profit of approximately $1.1 million. However, the impact on gross margin was favorable by about 0.7 points. The year-over-year increase in gross margins primarily reflects higher ASPs, resulting from our price increase, which was effective at the beginning of 2013 as well as the aforementioned impact from the change in our mid-course correction policy. Q3 gross margin for scanners and CAD/CAM services was 22.2%. This compares to 33.9% in Q2 and non-GAAP gross margin of 21.6% in the same quarter last year. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower scanner ASPs as a result of a reduction in the list price of our current scanner, combined with the promotion to sell our older scanners, as well as higher manufacturing costs. Our year-over-year improvement in this segment -- segment's margins was primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by lower ASPs. Q3 operating expenses were $83.6 million. This was down $2.2 million sequentially as a result of fewer customer events in the quarter as well as less media cost. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up $12.7 million, incidental to the growth of our business, as well as the impact of the medical device excise tax levied on our U.S. revenues. Our third quarter operating margin was 25.2%, up 2.1 points quarter-over-quarter and up 3.6 points when compared to a non-GAAP operating margin reported in the same quarter a year ago. With regards to our third quarter tax provision, results for the quarter benefited from a one-time tax credit of $1.3 million related to a true-up of our 2012 federal income taxes. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.42 compared to $0.36 reported in the same -- in the prior quarter, and a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.26 reported in the same quarter last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. For the third quarter, accounts receivable was $109.2 million, down approximately 3% sequentially. Our overall DSO was 60 days, a 2-day improvement sequentially and a 10-day improvement over the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.8 million. Cash flow from operations was $55.1 million. And free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures amounted to $49.3 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including both short and long-term investments, were $400.4 million. This compared to $356.1 million at the end of 2012. Now let's turn to our business outlook for the fourth quarter's and the factors that inform our view. While typically the third quarter reflects the peak season for teenage orthodontic case starts, the fourth quarter is often a slower period for North American orthos, as fewer teenagers start orthodontic treatment once the school year has started. As such, we expect North American orthos to be down sequentially in Q4. Offsetting this trend, our fourth quarter's historically been a stronger quarter for our international doctors and North American GPs as they rebound from a seasonally slower summer quarter. We expect volume for both international and North American GPs to be up sequentially in Q4. Our scanner business performed very well this past quarter despite an increasingly competitive environment and we expect our scanner volumes to remain consistent with third quarter performance. Our strong Q3 results reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and our outlook for Q4 assumes this trend will continue. With this as a backdrop, we expect our fourth quarter to shape up as follows: Invisalign case volume is anticipated to be in the range of 109,700 to 112,100 cases, reflecting a 21% to 24% year-over-year growth. We expect revenues to be in the range of $169.1 million to $173.1 million. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 74.7% to 75.3%, which primarily reflects higher training costs and mixed shift to lower-priced Invisalign products, that is less Invisalign Teen and more Invisalign Express. We expect operating expenses to be in the range of $83.8 million to $85.4 million, which primarily reflects continued investment in products and technologies as well as continued market expansion. Our operating margin should be in the range of 25.2% to 26.0%. Our effective tax rate should be approximately 21% and diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 82.2 million. Taken together, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.43. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing comments.\nThomas M. Prescott: Thanks, David. There's a lot of good work going on by the Align Technology team, and I'm very pleased to see our strong results reflect that effort. We continue to deliver solid execution of our long-term strategic plan and expect to continue those key initiatives, which are at the core of our progress. Our results also reflect stable patient traffic in our customers' offices and their willingness to let us become a more significant part of their practices. Our goal is to become their best partner in practice, providing great opportunities for growth, with every potential patient asking for Invisalign by name. We look forward to seeing our investors during the busy time for conferences and industry trade shows as well as reporting back to you with our year-end results in January. And with that, let's go to the -- with the question and answer session, operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert P. Jones: What a difference a year makes, Tom, David. Just looking at the ASPs, second straight quarter, where we saw some strong -- some support there on ASPs, actually some improvement across all the segments, I guess, could you talk a little bit more about the drivers of ASP and how we should be thinking about the pricing power going forward? Just really trying to figure out how much of this is a result of maybe comps versus an actual firming of pricing of your products in the market?\nDavid L. White: Hi, Robert, this is David. I'll see if I can't answer that for you. When you look at ASPs, as we publish on the website and so forth, those are an aggregate ASP for the entire company. And so one of the things that you don't necessarily see in there is what impact mix has on that. And so as you look at, if you look our business quarter-over-quarter, our Teen business is up very strongly sequentially and that came at the expense of some of the lower-end products that carry lower ASPs. And so those -- that tends to -- that mix shift there tends to cause the worldwide ASPs sometimes to look a little bit off. As it relates to your question about the purchasing price or the purchasing power of our product and competitive pressures on our product, as you know, we made a slight increase in prices of our product at the beginning of the year. Some of that was a result of the new medical device tax and so forth. But at this point in time, we haven't really made any further adjustments on pricing since then. So the effect that I think you're seeing, from an external standpoint, has really more to do with mix shift than anything.\nThomas M. Prescott: And Robert, if I could just pile on, the slide that Shirley and the team have put in here, on the very last slide in our webcast slides really try to break out those effects net of mix. And if you look at that in general, I would say pricing is stable net of mix and other factors. And so it's not so much a comp issue. We're actually -- pricing is pretty stable.\nRobert P. Jones: Got it. And then if I could just move over to the case guide, the 3% to 5% increase sequentially, seems like a big guide up, especially in light of some of the uncertainties that seem to be surrounding the consumer as we sit here in October, maybe more of a qualitative question, but was just wondering if you could talk a little bit of how you're factoring in some of the uncertainty in the marketplace and some of the pressures around consumer sentiment into your fourth quarter outlook?\nThomas M. Prescott: Let me maybe start and then may be a pull-up for David, since this is his first-cycle with us. I think his objective view might be useful here. But I guess what I'd first start with is that we have the same kind of visibility we always have in our business cycle, about 30 days or so. And what you're seeing is a fundamentally solid business today, with initiatives that are working for us. And I'd take you back to earlier in the year. We made investments exiting 2012 in headcount and coverage in our geographies: Europe, North America. We've made investments in new consumer programs. We spent a little more money. We've told our owners what we're doing purposely, our goal was to generate volume as we exit the year and we're starting to see that, so we're gratified by that. But it reflects what we're seeing in the business. And we're not smart enough to break apart all of the elements going on. But with that said, I think there's -- we've seen other data that patient traffic is stable to improving. Dental consumables are improving a bit. And when there's traffic in the offices, patients are willing to do a more expensive procedure, an implant, a restorative, then that means there that the road's wide open for us to get Invisalign growth. Maybe with that, I'll pivot -- let David build on his first-cycle here, preparing the guidance.\nDavid L. White: Thanks, Tom. Robert, I guess I would -- when I first joined the company, I would've thought that given 25,000 customers that we ship to in a quarter, that forecasting the business would lend itself to some econometric model. But as you kind of look under the hood, what you realize is we have a small number of doctors that have a very healthy practice with us that is fairly stable and relatively predictable. But on the other flipside of that, we have a lot of doctors that do a small amount of business with us, and that particular segment of our business tends to be more difficult to predict. So when I look at the process and so forth, we have a process that kind of does a bottoms up view from the field, in terms of where -- what our territory managers and so forth are seeing as they talk to their customers. We have a view from the tops down of the company, which takes a look at our own statistical correlation of trends and so forth. And then as Tom was saying, we also look at patient traffic and so forth and some of these other external data points, and we triangulate across all of those to come up with our best view of the world. It's -- from what I can tell and, I think, from what some of you have experienced, it's not perfect. We'd like it to get better. But I think what I can tell you, at least from what I've seen and observed and so forth, is I think we have a robust process. And I'd say it's representative of best practices across many industries.\nRobert P. Jones: All make sense. Just a last one David, I'd slide in just on the back of that. Any thoughts, I know kind of early days for you, but any thoughts about extending the outlook that you guys do provide? I know it's something that us on the sales side and I'm sure investors would appreciate very much.\nDavid L. White: Not at this point. We give a long-term operating model. I think our operating model is where we are steering the company towards and those are the results we're trying to head towards. So probably not at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.\nJohn Kreger: David, maybe just a quick follow-on to Bob's question. Any early thoughts on 2014? Obviously, you're not in the mode of providing full year guidance, but are there any kind of key issues that you think we ought to be thinking about that could be key swing factors, particularly around margins?\nDavid L. White: Well, John, a pleasure talking to you again. I guess what I would -- what I've observed and, I think, what you've observed as well is our business does have some degrees of cyclicality in it. Our business, certainly, from a revenue standpoint, has seasonality. Q3 perhaps being the largest manifestation of that. But further than that, there's other elements of our business that had cyclicality to it as well. Our media expenses, for example, might run counter seasonal. Then we make investments in the business that sometimes tend to be bulky and done on an as-needed basis and are not -- don't follow a pattern of repetition. So when you look at our Q3 performance that we've just announced and our Q4 guidance, I guess, the thing I would comment on is that I wouldn't use those 2 data points to extrapolate going forward. Because of that seasonality and because those 2 quarters alone do not manifest, I think, all the cyclicality that our business deals with. I think more representative of that -- of our business, however, there's our annual operating results. And I think that's probably the best guide because our annual results include -- incorporate all of those cycles in them. As you think about, going forward, as I said on the prior question, our targeted operating model is 25 to 30 points. And I think at some point, as we get to being able to consistently land within that operating model, at some point, we'll then update the model. But at this point, I think that the best guidance I can give you is the operating model we've already talked about.\nJohn Kreger: Just one last one and I'll stop. Could you give us an update on how realign is faring with the Henry Schein salesforce?\nThomas M. Prescott: I'll take that one, John. We're in very early days there. It is -- the Schein team and the Align team are working hard to ensure that the kind of the early customers and the field reps that are moving this have great experiences and we learn a lot from those cycles and make sure the product works perfectly for the patient. And Dr. Phil is creating the practice. So we kind of thought about the first year at startup. And we're right in the middle of that learning cycle, we're collectively about to head off to a trade show, the ADA, there's greater New York, there's some important cycles where Align will be out there in the market and Schein will be out there in the market, and we're going to have a chance to have that discussion with customers. So very early days, not going to be material for a significant amount of time, but way more strategic than kind of tactical. I don't know if that's what you're looking for. That's where I'll stop.\nJohn Kreger: And are you still comfortable, Tom, that the margins on that product can be consistent with the rest of the business?\nThomas M. Prescott: Yes. Short answer is yes. When we -- if we stack up the take out in marketing, professional marketing demand creation, go-to-market, our contribution margins will be similar to, on a net basis, similar to, say, an Express product for example, where we got direct sales and marketing involved.\nDavid L. White: At the operating level.\nThomas M. Prescott: At the operating margin level, below gross margin for sure, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Lewis from Roth Capital Partners.\nChris Lewis: First, I guess, Tom, you mentioned the North American Ortho case volume strength was driven partially by new ortho submitters. So I guess, can you just talk a bit more about what's driving those new orthos coming on board?\nThomas M. Prescott: It's really a couple of things. We've got more of those coming out of their graduate programs, maybe didn't get enough Invisalign in their program and as they're coming to a practice, they're very interested in, just trying to do Invisalign, that's 1. Two is we have some great established ortho practices that maybe got trained 10 or 12 years ago. I would say back in the early days, we weren't ready for prime time. They didn't have a great experience with the product. Couldn't address very complex needs. And as they've seen our progression, they have come to the view that they need to get on board. And so we've had a number of terrific kind of market-leading practices, want to reengage. In our mind, those are new practices, we haven't had business with them for years. And so that's the other part of the mix. Both are very positive, small numbers, but I think what's more important is what those kinds of practices represent over the next 3 to 5 years.\nChris Lewis: Okay. Great. And then, just on the gross margin side for the fourth quarter guidance, it's down sequentially. I think, you had mentioned some product mix, lower-priced products there, but can you just discuss a little further what other factors might be planned into that? And then, longer term, as we look on to 2014, how should we think about that gross margin trend unit?\nDavid L. White: Chris, let me see if I can give you a little color. As you look at our margins in the third quarter, they're, I think, almost a record, if they're not a record for the company, on the Invisalign side of the business. As we shift into Q4, however, though, we're going to see a lesser mix of you might say, the top end of our product line and that's going to get displaced with more volume in the lower end. So that mix shift is going to bring margins down to some extent. Then in my prepared comments, I made a comment that we had this mid-course correction that caused an adjustment to our deferrals, which is about 0.7 points of margin effect sequentially to Q3, but that's nonrecurring in Q4. And so we don't have the benefit of that in Q4. We also -- we'll have more training events this quarter. And when you -- we don't -- our training business is not an 80-point margin business. And so that will tend to drag the margins down a little bit as well. And offsetting those 3 is the fact that we -- is our scanner margins should improve quarter-over-quarter as well. And so the net of that is that margins should be down sequentially a little bit. As it relates to '14, again, I guess, the best guidance I could give you would be to look at the full year results, look at the trends, look at the -- and look at the operating margin, the targets or the business model that we talked about and I would plan off of those things.\nChris Lewis: Okay. Great. And if I could sneak one more in. Tom, just going back to the visibility into the business, I was hoping you could talk about how maybe that's evolved over the past, say, 12 months. Seems like, I think, you're talking about improving that visibility in recent quarters, some office surveys and other initiative to gauge more of a month-to-month trend in patient traffic and other market trends. So how has that evolved over the past year compared to third quarter of last year? And then, how that contributed in the fourth quarter guidance that was given today?\nThomas M. Prescott: So I'll take my shot with -- while I'm knocking on wood, we're glad to have the positive results. I think, the starting point for all this is: A, we have the same kind of visibility we've always had in the core flow of the business; and then, B, our customers don't forecast, so asking them forecasting questions doesn't necessarily lead you to a factual framework you can count on. What is different, there are a few things different. The evolution of business this Q3 and Q4 from last year is fundamentally different. Patient traffic started declining in U.S. dentists office in the middle of Q2 last year, as we reconstructed all that. Procedures started falling with them, and mix shifted to lower value procedures, that really wasn't visible well into Q3 and we didn't really see it until summer didn't kind of bounce back. So that's different and that's why we keep stressing that stable to slightly improving patient traffic, mix in procedures is a really good thing for us. It's a good thing for everybody, but it's really good for Invisalign. To your second point about what we're doing differently, we do a lot more differently, a lot of things differently. When you get it wrong or you get humbled or you get surprised, you ask yourself a lot of questions about what can we do. Everything's on the table. We have instituted a whole series of what we internally call poll surveys. And it's not so much of forecasting, I just call it observational. We haven't been at that even a full year yet now in detail. And I would say we're far short of predictable kind of results. Our goal over time is going to be able to correlate some of that with other external factors like patient traffic. Empirical data we can observe. But boy, we're well short of what I'd call predictive capabilities. So what is reflected in our outlook, what is reflected in our results is good execution of business and everything we can control and a very solid environment out there in the countries that matter for us. And then, maybe the third fact is we have this very low penetration for Invisalign into a pretty big darn space and we still have a lot of headroom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.\nSteve Beuchaw: I wonder, Tom, if we're far enough along that you could give us a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing with SmartTrack? Have you been able to get a view of what kind of impact that's having in practices that were maybe early adopters or beta testers, any discernible or hopefully quantifiable impact on how the mix of ortho cases there is impacted in terms of the percentage of cases that are going to Aligners in those practices?\nThomas M. Prescott: Sure. Simple answer is for the most frequent users of Invisalign, including some of those that were in the pilots, even a year before we released, and others that just see, most quickly see the benefits, they have virtually all expanded case complexity and gotten most of the benefit out of it. We are still, I would say, working through our complete customer base. For a customer that does, even a great orthodontist that's only doing 10 or 15 a year, it's taking them longer to see the benefits because they generally are treating simpler cases. And they're just -- they don't have the at-bats that a high-volume doc doing 200 or 300 Invisalign cases a year would. But on those higher volume practices that are -- their progression has been towards greater complexity and earning a bigger part of their practice. And they say kind of yes to Invisalign more often when that patient asks, that's the short answer.\nRobert P. Jones: Is there a case for 5 points of mix shift over some horizon, can you quantify any of this for us?\nThomas M. Prescott: It's not -- I wish it was as simple as that. We actually have some internal ways we measure it. And we look at the kind of the incidences, what presents with a -- at an average orthodontist or dentist office for the malocclusion and put them into categories, and then we look at what that incidence is and then what they treat against that mix. That same chart varies widely by the practice and how much they've adopted Invisalign. So we have 2 things. In our most ardent supporters, we get the biggest chunk of their Class 1 crowding cases, adult and even teens. And again, teens are harder cases to fill because everybody's aiming for absolutely perfect. And if they think they're making any clinical tradeoffs, they're going to be more resistant using Invisalign. But at least for adults, we're doing very well there. As you get over towards more straightforward Class 2 or even hard Class 3, the doctors that have got the greatest confidence and have had the greatest results with Invisalign are much more comfortable offering that to an adult patient. So there's a temporal framework that goes along that opportunity. The least frequent users are the least penetrated to those indications would be most around Class 1. And the most frequent users who have the greatest confidence are doing it on much more complex cases. So it's not as simple, I'm sorry to say, I wish it was, to say there's a projection of growth or share, but both are being driven by evolutions like SmartTrack and G4 that give us both greater confidence and because they're getting better results with those tools.\nSteve Beuchaw: Got it. And then, as my follow-up, I wonder if you could give us an update on your thinking around partnerships in the world of inter-oral scanners. I wonder if there's any new thinking there? And I wonder, now that you have a relationship with Henry Schein that's expanded, if that might be a gateway, if some of the Henry Schein partnerships might be more logical for you? And then, I'll drop.\nThomas M. Prescott: Sure. Thanks, Steve. The update is when there's news to talk about for interoperability, we will be happy to do so. We think it's strategically valuable. You saw we keep going up around 250 to 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter in cases coming, just with the iTero base among our customers. And we know there's interest out there. So it's in our best strategic interest to have those partnerships and you ought to assume that we're interested in doing that. But until we get there and can actually validate appropriate high quality scanners, I don't want to project.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens.\nChristopher C. Cooley: Could you help us think more towards gross margins and specifically, when we think about the contribution of fourth quarter and out in the '14 for more value-oriented product offerings like Express 5, how do we think about that in combination with the ramp of Realine, which I realize is still in early days right now, but assuming it has to become a bigger part of the mix, how do we kind of weigh that when we kind of think forward on the gross margin guidance? And I have a quick follow-up.\nDavid L. White: Yes. Again, we've had a few questions about 2014, and I guess, it's not surprising given our results in Q3 and Q4. As Tom said earlier, as it relates to Realine, it's really too early to call, to put a vector on that and to give any guidance as it relates to how that product will impact overall mix. As it relates to gross margins, we've continued to comment, I think, that as we look over the long term, that the percentage of cases that we treat, particularly for simple cases with adults and so forth will increase, and that will potentially drive down margins -- drive down ASPs, I should say. And clearly, our margins are influenced by product mix. But given that we're still growing well into double-digits year-over-year, while that may have some bearing on the directional indicators for margins, these gross margins, I don't think they'll necessarily have an indication of an effect, I guess, on operating margins. So going back to, I guess, the comments I made before, I think the best guidance for '14 is, again, going to be our operating model that we talked about.\nChristopher C. Cooley: Fair enough. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. When we think about the scanner business, 22.2%, I believe, the gross for the quarter, could you give us a feel there in terms of the mix, what's being placed versus what's actually being sold into the channel and how that may or may not be changing?\nThomas M. Prescott: I'll see if I can take that one, and David can pile on if he wants to. First of all, the reported gross margins are nowhere near where we want them to be or where we expect to get them over time. If I understood your question, in terms of new systems going in versus services stream, was that the question?\nChristopher C. Cooley: Yes.\nThomas M. Prescott: I think, we spoke about roughly half and half in terms of the mix of services against new scanner placements.\nDavid L. White: I would just add to that, as our scanners -- as we continue to penetrate the market with more and more scanners, that mix should go more favorably towards the service and licensing sides of that over time.\nThomas M. Prescott: With higher margins.\nDavid L. White: Over time with higher margins.\nChristopher C. Cooley: If I could, Tom, just to follow on or to clarify that, when the actual system is placed, is the system sold outright or they placed early on, on a volume commitment, I'm just trying to tease out why the margin's at 22%?\nThomas M. Prescott: Well, the margin's at 22% because our build material and cost of goods, we have the best scanner in the market and we don't make money on them. We -- and with pricing that has come down over the last 1.5 years, 2 years, with a lot of competitive entries, we've met that pricing, pricing is actually stabilizing a bit in the scanner market, have raised -- coming up a little bit. And we do think scanners will be ubiquitous. We think it's critically important for us to be at chair-side in the middle of a clinical discussion with the patient right there, and then, creating advantages for our Invisalign franchise and other things we intend to do over the long term. So with that said, the gross margins aren't anywhere near where we want them on the scanner. We intend to fix that over time. The services stream is better and we think we've actually got some strategic advantage there over time. But it's just the build material that's expensive, and it's the best scanner in the market, which is a kick, but we'll fix that over time.\nDavid L. White: Yes, and just to add to that, as I said earlier, just to make it maybe clearly, state it more clearly, that service element should grow against -- it's in proportion with the install base, and not in proportion to the number of systems we're selling in any particular quarter. The other thing, as you talk about the 22% gross margins in the second -- in the third quarter, some of that was also the result of the fact that we were selling, under promotional programs, some of our older scanners. So that had -- that promotion to kind of move some of that inventory had a dampening effect on margins in the third quarter and that's one of the reasons why the margins in that business should be up in the fourth.\nThomas M. Prescott: Chris, I just realized, I didn't answer a part of your question. You were theorizing maybe there was placements instead of sales, we really don't do that. So those are all sales. Whether there was a financing involved, we don't finance either, but whether it was financed for us, it was a net sale, period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.\nJeffrey D. Johnson: All of my questions have largely been answered here, let me just ask one, Tom. I want to make sure I understand the timing comments on the DTC, I was surprised, your DTC spending may be down this quarter, I know it had kind of flared up in the second quarter as you launched some of these new programs. And so is that just kind of a normal kind of ebb and flow of that spending? How are you thinking about maybe DTC spending given that it seems to be generating some nice top line, how are you thinking about that spending over the next several quarters to couple of years?\nThomas M. Prescott: Sure. I think, as David was talking about, the broader issue of the timing and mix of spending isn't always in the same cycle with volume expansion given cyclicality, seasonality et cetera. And the example, I believe, was summertime is typically our strongest media, traditional media, digital media, everything else. And it's often a softer quarter, given the seasonality, people out on holiday in Europe, and certainly in North America, where we advertise most. So in general, there is a general consistency to our program spending on consumer and that is light in Q1, heavier exiting Q1, stronger into Q2, setting up for the summer season, heaviest spending exiting Q2 into the summer, and then pretty strong through all the summer, slowing as we exit Q3 into Q4. And you probably shouldn't see us by the time Christmas advertising is on in general just because there's so much noise. That is -- and now there's a whole -- there's a parallel mix of digital PR. Again, this integrated campaign, if you see for every TV commercial that you might see on one of the -- Bravo or one of the channels we work with, there's probably 10x that activity through multiple other platforms, whether it's Pandora for radio, whether it's gaming and other things. So that's the visible part in traditional media on TV. But again, there is generally the same profile for that spending in North America. Does that get at your question?\nJeffrey D. Johnson: Yes, that does. And I guess, last year, you had obviously some timing shifts or some fall off probably to that normal cyclicality, just given the Olympics and that, but I would assume, looking forward, nothing on the horizon we need to be thinking about that might shift that timing, at least in the near intermediate term?\nThomas M. Prescott: The Winter Olympics is nowhere near the media frenzy of Summer Olympics. We don't have an election year. There's a lot of things that you have to engineer around in the media world. This should -- I don't know what normal is in the dental industry but if we had to imagine a normal, this feels like more of a normal. Now the second thing is we were off the air a bit more exiting '12 because we were getting ready to launch a whole new campaign. And I think, when we spoke about our guidance in January for the year, we were talking about investing in new assets, a creation of new creative and materials and all the associated elements that go along on the digital side and everything else. So all that, that's where the spending was, it wasn't necessarily visible media that was part of the first half year -- first half of the year profile in greater spending. So again -- but in general, you should expect stepwise expansion investment and the same kind of impact that we expect to get for payback year-to-year.\nShirley Stacy: Operator, we'll take one more question, please -- we'll take 2 more questions, we've got time for 2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.\nS. Brandon Couillard: David, just curious if you could give us an update on where we stand on the NOLs and when you expect to have to begin paying cash taxes, whether that's anytime soon?\nDavid L. White: So I'll say, we do pay -- I'll be clear here, we do pay some cash taxes. Typically, those are in foreign jurisdictions and in states here in the U.S.. As far as our U.S. federal return is concerned, we do have NOL carryforwards. And currently, today, obviously, we're making money here in the U.S.. Those taxes, however -- that income, however, though, the taxes on net income, we do have the benefit of R\u0026D tax credit, which offsets that to some degree, we also have the benefit of stock exercises and the ability to deduct some of that off of it. And so it means that we use up less of our NOL than what we might have otherwise in the absence of those credits. Altogether, our estimation is that our NOLs will probably run sometime into or through around 2015.\nS. Brandon Couillard: Great. And then, just one more for you, given this is your first conference call as the new CFO, I would be curious to hear your view around how you think about capital allocation and share repurchase in general with cash building on the balance sheet pretty substantially here?\nDavid L. White: Well, I guess, I would say, philosophically, that if a company is accumulating cash and doesn't have a need for that cash to either grow its business and just to run the business, then at some point, there should be a plan to figure out how to return that to shareholders. That said, we just finished here in line, as I'm sure you know, $150 million stock repurchase plan in the June quarter. 95 -- $93 million of which was spent in that quarter. And so we just completed one of those plans. We haven't really quite come up for air yet. I would tell you that as we kind of look at our annual plan for next year and our 5-year strategic plan, we are right now pulling together what we think our investment requirements are going to be for the company. And clearly, those investments will, at some point, are going to mean added manufacturing capacity, market expansions, we're going to have both domestic needs, as well as international needs. And at this point, we haven't really assimilated how all that's going to fit together. But at some point, we will in the not-too-distant future here. And to the extent we come to a conclusion, at least with the board, that we have excess cash that we don't need as a company. We'll figure out what plan we're going to do with it. But right now, as of today, we're just not ready to declare what that next step will be. But I think, if you can be patient with us, we'll probably have more to say about that in the not-too-distant future.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of John Block from Stifel Nicolaus.\nJonathan D. Block: Maybe I can just slip in 2 or 3 questions. I guess, the first one, on the investment side, and I'm also guessing people are going to stop asking if you're staying by your long-term margin guidance, on the investment side, you've done a ton in the past 12 months, APAC, you've added North American reps, you did some work in the international side, and then you're starting to obviously post a leverage. I think, in the past, the spend has been very lumpy. And so, Tom, can you just speak broadly about incremental investments from here, maybe not detailing what exactly they're going to be, but again, will you pull back at all, will they be as lumpy as they've been in the past? Any color would be great.\nThomas M. Prescott: I guess, I have to start with the word lumpy. From our perspective, the business cycle itself here in the dental industry is cyclical. Maybe use that instead of lumpy. And in many areas, these investments, it doesn't make sense to line up investment choices that are multiyear in nature and have a strategic value to fit them perfectly, maybe fit them generally, yes, but not fit them perfectly into that kind of annual cycle we see. Q3 being a great example of one that's softer. So where we choose to make investments that during a quarter or 2 would take operating margins down a little bit, as we did in Q1 when -- or into Q2 as well where we talked about it with the yearend results in January of this year, we also made the commitment that we expected to be able to generate volume growth. And I think, David said it well earlier, we think looking at the model, in terms of our annual performance is the right way to look, and so the question is going to be we know that's not how you have to model on a quarterly basis and the reports you put out, but from our perspective, we're trying to deliver an annual result with the quarters that make sense, and some of the spending, an example is consumer is going to be in advance of that volume step up. And in this case, this year, it was also on top of substantial headcount investment that we had all completed by end of Q1. All that headcount was in North American sales force on an incremental basis. And you had virtually none of the volume was coming in yet. We had a new media camp, a new consumer campaign going on yet, with very little impact felt yet. So that's great examples of where it's the right thing to do and the timing is better to get at it quickly and get it in. So simply stated, I think, we will continue to be a little more cyclical in our total operating margin profile. But where we are on the lower side of that, I believe we'll continue to articulate what the spending is going towards so that our owners can understand that the kinds of things we're investing in, we have high confidence will lead to either increased earnings, in the case of the right kind of factory, or increasing volume, and ultimately, operating margins on an annual basis.\nJonathan D. Block: Okay. And then, just shifting gears over to teen, it was up 18% year-over-year and it looks like some of that was a little bit lower on teen growth from GPs. It's certainly good numbers, but it's a second quarter in a row where you sort of had a decel into the mid to high-teen level, and then it goes mid-20s in 2012. So I'm just trying to find something to pick on. I mean, what do you think about growth in teen going forward? You mentioned, hey, they're looking for perfection. Is SmartTrack starting to give them better conviction that they can get there with Invisalign? Again, any thoughts would be great.\nThomas M. Prescott: Sure. If this is the only thing we've given you to pick on, I'm really happy as CEO. Look, first of all, we're thrilled with the progress we're making. We've said for a long time that earning that marginal teen case is the hardest case to wrestle away from brackets and wires, which is still standard of care. So we have to be better than brackets and wires in many ways. And we're getting there. Now I think it was a question earlier that I answered, that was comparing where each practices and their adoption and their clinical confidence, a practice that uses a lot of Invisalign in adults and teens doesn't seem to worry about it. They'll lead with Invisalign. A practice that's more conservative that is just now maybe starting to get SmartTrack is just now starting to get more complex crowding cases on adults. And so our goal is over time, is to move practice by practice, this progression through and have them see that experience firsthand, have the patients be thrilled, get those great results. And that just reinforces their own journey. So it's literally that practice by practice process that we're encouraging. On a numbers basis, we get big enough. The denominator gets tougher, 18%, 21%. We're in the right neighborhood and we're thrilled with the process. SmartTrack is a big part of that, G4, all the rest of it. We can't do enough consumer advertising if the product -- if they're not confident the product doesn't work. So the right coverage in clinical education and clinical support, the right product evolution and the right consumer, those 3 legs of the stool go together really well for the teen market and we're very confident over the mid to longer-term, our goal is frankly to become standard of care in orthodontics. The teen market is the last place, we'll get there.\nJonathan D. Block: Okay. And last question, if I can just jump in there David, this might be for you. International ASP, and those slides are helpful, but international ASP looked like it was down sequentially despite what I believe was an extra month from APAC in a euro that went in your favor. So what am I missing on why international ASP would just be down Q over Q?\nDavid L. White: Well, you're right to pick up on foreign exchange. I mean, that was a benefit to us, about $1 million in the quarter. But again, back to the comment I made before, when you look at these ASPs, it's an average across the mix of products that we're selling. And so, when that mix changes, the ASP can come down, even though -- you can point to examples where the price on every single product could go up quarter-over-quarter, but if the mix changes, the overall could look like it's going down. So there's really no trend there that I think you should be concerned about. It's really more of a mix shift than anything else, I believe.\nShirley Stacy: Well, operator, that concludes our formal comments today. We thank you for joining us and look forward to seeing you at upcoming financial conferences and interesting meetings. If you have any further comments or questions, please contact Investor Relations.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

I'll now turn the call over to Mary.\nMary N. Dillon: Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report solid top line performance in the third quarter and, in particular, rapid growth in our e-commerce business despite a tougher-than-expected sales environment. After seeing good momentum in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, our sales trends in retail customer transactions softened somewhat in late September and October. We adjusted our promotional strategy to drive transactions and deliver healthy top line growth but gave up a bit of margin in the process. We nonetheless delivered solid earnings growth in line with sales growth, excluding severance charges, and made good progress in each of our key strategies. To recap the headlines, we grew sales 22.4% and delivered a 6.8% total company comp, following an 8.9% comp in the third quarter of 2012, both including the impact of online sales growth. E-commerce built on a strong momentum with 74% growth, contributing 170 basis points to the comp. Prestige Cosmetics and skincare continue to be the strongest categories while we experienced some softness in the nail and fragrance categories, consistent with industry-wide trends. Our comp was driven entirely by ticket, evenly split between units per transaction and average selling price, while transactions were slightly negative. Part of this transaction decline was driven by this year's strategy of reducing and better targeting our coupons and price promotions intended to reduce reliance on such discounts over time. We also believe we experienced a wider weakness in traffic that many retailers felt in the third quarter. In light of this change in trend, we elected late in the quarter to increase our promotions in order to protect our market share gains in an incrementally tougher retail landscape. GAAP earnings per share were $0.70, up 18%. Earnings per share, excluding severance charges and retention costs, were $0.72, up 22%. Charges for severance and retention costs resulted from changes at the senior management level to strengthen media capabilities in supply chain and human resources. We achieved slightly less gross margin expansion than we planned as a result of our increased level of promotion to drive sales late in the quarter. Investments in supply chain, e-commerce and labor came in as expected. The current trend in the business and the overall heightened promotional environment for the holiday season are making us more cautious on earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and heading into next year. As you've seen in the press release, we've lowered our earning growth rate expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013. In addition, while we're still in the midst of the budgeting process and haven't finalized our plan for 2014, based on what we know today about our square footage plans likely in the 15% range and several investments we need to prioritize to drive sustainable long-term growth, we expect that our earnings growth next year will likely be in a similar range to the current year. Looking even further ahead, I'm sure you're all anxious to understand how this more muted view of the end of the current year and next year fits into our long-term sales and earnings algorithm. Right now, our first priority is to focus on delivering a strong holiday for Ulta and to continue to deliver market share gains. We're also focused on the long-term view and are currently conducting an in-depth and future-focused strategic planning process to align and prioritize our growth strategies, as well as the additional investments we'll need to make -- we'll need to make to remain a high-performance and high-growth company. Since I joined Ulta Beauty in July, I've continued to be impressed by the strength of our business model and the passion of our associates. I'm confident in our ability to offer a differentiated total experience for our guests now and into the future, whether in our store, our salon or online. Over the next several years, it's clear that our square footage growth will necessarily moderate off a larger base, and we'll need to find new ways to grow. I believe there are significant opportunities ahead for Ulta in areas such as driving higher brand awareness; developing smaller and urban store formats; increasing our digital presence, both online and in-store; and growing our capabilities to enable initiatives like localization of assortment. I've also seen we need to upgrade our capabilities in certain areas which will require additional investment over a multi-year horizon in order to achieve our growth aspirations. Some of the areas we plan to invest in include: customer-facing training in our stores and salons; systems investments to improve the customer experience; digital marketing to drive brand awareness and a multi-year supply chain project, including a new warehouse in 2015. As we complete our in-depth strategic planning process over the next several months, we plan to be in a position to update our long-term growth targets. We expect to remain a high-performance, high-growth company while building an even stronger foundation for the future. Scott will provide more details on our financial results for the third quarter and our guidance in a moment, but first I'd like to update you on recent progress on the 5 components of our strategy to build an even stronger business for the long term: store growth; new products, services and brands; our loyalty program; marketing and ulta.com. Starting with real estate. We opened up 55 stores during the quarter, the most new stores we've ever opened in one quarter. With additional 10 stores already open in the early fourth quarter and one planned for January, we are close to completion of our 2013 real estate program of 125 stores and remain very pleased with the team's execution of store openings and the productivity of our new stores. We're still finalizing our plans for our 2014 real estate program and expect to grow square footage approximately 15%. We also plan to remodel several more stores than we did this year and are still finalizing the scope of the remodel program. We also anticipate a large number of smaller in-store projects such as additional prestige boutiques and reflowing the mass cosmetics planogram in some of the older stores to make the shopping experience in that category more consistent across the chain. We believe this balanced approach will lead to continued excellent store performance, but will obviously have an impact on the top line following 2 years of 22% to 23% square footage growth. Turning now to merchandising. We continue to expand our portfolio with new brands, products and services. In fact, it's been my pleasure over the past several months to meet many of our key vendor partners to learn about their businesses and brands and collaborate on how we'll continue to partner together. Recent launches of IT Cosmetics and Mally have been very strong out of the gate, and we're seeing excellent performance from brands like Urban Decay and many of the exclusive kits we've developed with them and several other prestige brands. In the personal care appliances category, the innovative Curl Secret from Conair has been a hit with our customers, and we expect it to be a big seller through the holidays. To update you on the rollout of Lancôme and Clinique boutiques, as of the end of Q3, we've completed the buildout of these prestige boutiques that we planned for this year. We now have 100 stores with Clinique boutiques and 105 stores with Lancôme boutiques. Customers are responding very well to our offering in both brands, which add to our positioning as a beauty destination. We continue to see rapid growth also in the Benefit brand. We now have Benefit Brow Bars in 500 stores, and 225 of these stores are offering the new service of brow tinting, which is off to a great start. A strong services offering combined with a steady stream of launches of successful products are making Benefit one of the fastest-growing brands in our portfolio. Looking ahead, we see a strong pipeline of new brands and innovation in the beauty industry. While we don't generally launch many new brands in the fourth quarter, as we're focusing on holiday, we're excited to announce exclusively at Ulta, the Japonesque Color Collection, a beautifully packaged line of prestige cosmetics from the brand famous for high-quality brushes. We also introduced the new Pedi Sonic from Clarisonic, adding to this brand's high-growth portfolio of skin care tools. The highly anticipated Urban Decay Naked3 palette will be launching next week, with a significant marketing plan to take advantage of that franchise's cult following. Turning to salon. The salon team continues to have a great year with strong top line performance, which again this quarter, contributed to the total company comp. With solid execution and promotions, expansion of services like lash extensions and programs that are improving the tenure of our stylists, the salon team is gaining share. We continue to see significant opportunity to drive awareness and trial of our services offering and differentiate Ulta as the perfect beauty destination. Moving on to an update on our loyalty programs and customer relationship management platform. We currently have 12.5 million active loyalty members who have shopped within the last 12 months, up 18% compared to last year, in part driven by a loyalty sweepstakes program during the quarter which drove strong new customer acquisition. We continue to see increases in retention in our loyalty customer base, and average sales per existing customer are growing. We're on track to convert all our customers to the ULTAmate Rewards program in the first quarter of 2014. Having all our customers on the points-based program will enable more efficient use of our CRM platform. And now turning to marketing. During the quarter, we executed our signature 21 Days of Beauty event, featuring special deals and events focused on prestige brands. We continue our support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in October through the sale of products in our stores, events like our Salon Cut-A-Thon and other events and programs designed to raise awareness of the cause. In November, we ran a 2-week event in 100 stores called Brows Across America to highlight Benefit brow services. This program exceeded expectations, driving incremental sales, as well as awareness and excitement in our stores. We also continued to evolve our tactics to reduce reliance on price promotions, such as tailoring our offers and better segmentation of our customer base and increased brand equity events like the ones just mentioned. While this change did have a somewhat dampening effect on the transactions versus a year ago, we do feel this is a better way to build our business over the long term. We'll continue to refine this strategy, and we'll be nimble with our promotional cadence so we can respond to changes in the environment the way we did late in the quarter. We're confident we're building better tools and better insights to pursue a stronger promotion strategy in the long run. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and important holiday season, we're focused on continuing to grow market share to a strong set of offerings, including a strength in gift with purchase program and marketing campaigns designed around some of our hottest new fragrances. Next week, we're launching a marketing campaign designed to generate excitement about the launch of the Urban Decay Naked3 palette, offering fans a chance to buy the latest palette in advance of the official launch. And wrapping up with our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business. Q3 was an excellent quarter for ulta.com, demonstrating continued momentum on the top line despite tough prior year comparisons and a major site relaunch. Our limited-time Beauty Breaks!, our sample beauty bags and CRM program all contributed to better-than-expected sales growth. Ulta.com delivered continued margin improvement through growing scale, better supply chain capabilities and a favorable product mix. The biggest news for ulta.com is the launch of our new website, a significant step forward for us. The platform was rolled out over a period of several weeks to make sure the new site was operating the way we planned. The new site enhances visibility to our product assortment, highlighting bestsellers and featuring products across all categories. Search capabilities were vastly improved, and brands were recognized for better visibility. Ulta is one of the first retailers to feature Responsive Web Design, a new technology that enables a consistent browsing experience regardless of the device the customer is using, be it a laptop, mobile phone or tablet. The new site is receiving positive consumer feedback on the usability improvements and browsing experience, and we're seeing an increase in conversion rates on the new site. I'd like to congratulate our entire team for their great execution and focus in delivering a top-notch website and supporting a successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday. On the supply chain side, we continue to ramp up the volume of e-commerce orders fulfilled out of our Northeast D.C. Chambersburg is well-staffed for the holidays and operating very effectively. Our associates supporting our e-commerce business in both Romeoville and Chambersburg are working very hard to support customer demand throughout this holiday season. This completes my updates of the progress on our 5 growth priorities. And with that, now I'll hand it over to Scott.\nScott M. Settersten: Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. We recorded total sales of $618.8 million compared to $505.6 million last year, an increase of 22.4%, with a comp store sales increase of 6.8%. The retail comp was 5.1%, and e-commerce growth of 74% added 170 basis points to the comp. Gross profit dollars increased 24.9% to $231.7 million, and gross profit margin rose 70 basis points to 37.4% from 36.7% in Q3 of last year, driven by strength in our prestige categories and better-than-expected leverage of fixed costs. While strong, this margin expansion was a bit less than our guidance due to an uptick in promotional activity later in the quarter to drive sales amid weaker-than-expected consumer traffic. SG\u0026A expenses, excluding the impact of the severance charges Mary mentioned, rose 26.7% to $149.5 million, up 90 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24.2%. This was driven by the planned investments on our new website, supply chain project, store labor and brand awareness that we've discussed previously, in line with our expectations. Preopening expense increased to $7.5 million compared to $6.3 million last year, driven by 55 store openings during the quarter compared to 49 new stores opened during Q3 of last year. Operating margin, including the severance charges, decreased 30 basis points to 11.8% versus 12.1% last year. Net income increased 19.1% to $45.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, versus $38.2 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, last year. Excluding the severance charges, EPS was $0.72, or 22% growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $582.3 million at the end of the quarter compared to $462.8 million at the end of Q3 2012, up 1.7% on a per-store basis. This is consistent with our plan for the year where, after making permanent investments in inventory at the end of last year to improve InStyle levels and continuing to invest in prestige boutiques, we expect to see inventory per door growth below comp growth by the end of the year. Capital expenditures were $78.9 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $27 million. Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. Based on current sales trends, less certainty about consumer sentiment and what appears to be shaping up to be a highly promotional holiday season, we believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view of the fourth quarter from a margin perspective since we are focused, as we have always been, on maintaining strong market share gains. We expect sales to increase in the range of $853 million to $867 million versus $758.8 million last year, which included an extra week. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 7% to 9%. Our same-store sales comparison for the quarter is based on weeks 40 to 52. We have 2 elements at work in Q4 that drive the comp metric but do not translate to earnings: first, we benefit from the comparison to the disruption we experienced due to the Superstorm Sandy disaster, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 comp by roughly 100 basis points; second, we have an easier comparison as a result of not lapping the 53rd week of 2012, which was a strong sales week. Absent these one-time impacts, our comp guidance would be 5% to 7%. We will open 11 new stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2013 plan versus 13 in last year's fourth quarter, so preopening expense is expected to be in line with last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.10 compared to last year, which it was $1, which included about $0.05 of benefit from the extra week. Gross profit margin is now expected to be flat as we prepare to participate in a highly promotional holiday season. SG\u0026A rate is expected to increase 50 basis points versus last year's 20.3% rate due to planned investments in the business. Operating margin may be expected to decrease approximately 50 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2%, and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 65 million. Turning now to the full year 2013. In light of the weaker-than-expected back half of the year and conservative earnings view on Q4, we now expect 2013 to come in at an earnings growth rate in the 20% range, adjusted for the 53rd week last year, compared to our previous expectation of mid-20s percentage EPS growth. We expect the full year comp to be in the range of 7% to 8%, and CapEx will be approximately $225 million. As you know, we give specific guidance about the coming year on our Q4 conference call in March. We are not changing that practice. At this point in the year, we are deep in our planning process for 2014. While we are not yet prepared to give specific guidance for next year, we wanted to share some of our preliminary views. First, we expect square footage growth to moderate off a larger base to about 15% versus 22% this year. Second, while the beauty category overall continues to grow, industry growth in both prestige and mass had been less robust in recent years, and a deceleration has continued during 2013. We have also seen weaker trends in several categories, including nail and fragrance, consistent with the industry. Third, we expect to continue to invest for the future in areas that will improve the guest experience and give us stronger multi-channel capabilities, primarily in the areas of supply chain and in-store technology improvements. We are still in the process of making decisions for 2014 to deliver the best possible results while investing for the future. However, assuming industry growth dynamics remain unchanged and a less certain consumer macro environment continues into next year, we believe it is prudent to plan for earnings growth similar to 2013, as we may have to maintain a more promotional posture to maintain market share gains. As Mary mentioned, we have some work to do on our long-range plan before providing a definitive update on our longer-term growth expectations. So stay tuned for more details on the multi-year view beyond 2014. On a final note, I'd like to remind you all that on our June conference call, we announced that we were discontinuing our practice of announcing holiday sales in early January. With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q\u0026A session. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Oliver Chen of Citigroup.\nNancy Hilliker: This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. I -- my first question is related really to the promotional strategy. Have you guys seen a difference in promotion, different ideas that you have been testing over the past quarter and the past month? And then is there any approach to maybe competitors offering prestige beauty online? Are you seeing any approach -- a different approach to strategy in terms of that as well?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, let me take a start at this, which is in terms of promotions, I would say that over the course of the year, we have been, I think, smartly experimenting with different ways to drive consumer retention and value with less discounting. So through the use of our CRM capabilities and some tweaks to some of our other tactics, we've been learning and experimenting with what our parameters are around how we can sort of drive long-term growth with little bit less reliance on promotion. And as we said, as we saw the environment start to change towards the end of the third quarter, the great thing is that we were able to nimbly, I would say, adjust and adapt to that because we have tools that we can turn very quickly. So we're going to continue to look for ways for the long haul. We can reduce some reliance on promotion and price discounts. But also, as we said in the call, we want to play to win, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter, as we expect it to be very promotional.\nNancy Hilliker: And then any -- just as a follow-up, any thoughts as to the online competitors? Are there any other promotional strategies maybe that you can use to continue to gain market share?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, first of all, it's a -- there's a lot of activity in this category, that's for sure, and we are certainly aggressive. Our e-commerce performance in the quarter, we're very proud about that, and particularly the change for our new website, which is performing extremely well with even stronger conversion. So we're constantly watching the competitive environment certainly. And I don't think there's anything that we've seen that surprised us, but we know we should be in a stance to continue to be aggressive. And again, with our tools being more nimble and facile, and I think more consumer-friendly on our website, it gives us the opportunity to continue to play very strong.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan.\nBrian J. Tunick: I guess just looking ahead for a second first, Scott, does it make sense, broadly speaking, that if you're guiding us for 15% square footage growth and for earnings growth next year to be similar to this year, that, that would embed a 50-, 60-basis-point operating margin expansion? And just wondering, if that's true, what buckets or what areas would be gross or SG\u0026A that you would expect operating margin expansion? And then does your view that the earnings -- or your guidance is under a view going forward, does that take away the midteen operating margin that the previous management team had offered to the Street before, given how you guys are now looking at the business model with slowing category growth?\nScott M. Settersten: Thanks, Brian. I guess the first thing I would say is we're not giving any specific guidance for 2014 at this point in time. But being mindful of your question, I think directionally, we would think 2014 would shape up much in the way that 2013 did, with the emphasis and the strategy being on trying to lever back on the promotional environment overall and continuing to develop the guest experience in the store to drive the business, long-term profitable growth of the guest experience in our stores. So big picture, I would say it's more in the merchandise margin and gross profit line, directionally speaking, for 2014. Again, much like it was in 2013. As with respect to the midteens operating margin target, again, I would say that we're suspending that initially by what we're seeing here for the near term on 2014 and what we think the guidance targets are for 2014.\nOperator: The next question is from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research.\nAram Rubinson: You guys have a very high dollars per square foot level, around $415, and it seems like you are trying to figure out the balance between how much of that is kind of sticky customers and how much of that might be cherry pickers, because you're struggling maybe to balance the promotional cadence. If you were to kind of look at your customer base and say, hey, that $415, if we had kind of the right customers in the store for the brand, where do you think that sales per square foot number would actually be? I'm just trying to figure out how much of there might be at risk. And then if you can also just tell us how you're fiddling with the promotional cadence, just to kind of make sure that, that drop-off, if there is one, doesn't happen too quick?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, let me just start in a couple of ways. One is that we -- as we described in terms of the full year expectations, this is -- we are still performing at a strong level in terms of top line growth and really, one of the top in the industry. So we're not troubled by what we're seeing in terms of our customer trends. What we are doing is reacting to an environment that looks to be more promotional and also being mindful of future investments that we believe need to be made to continue to support our growing business. So our base of customers right now is strong. I mean, we've got a really strong loyalty membership group of customers who are very responsive, and we're learning as we're tweaking some of our tactics about how to really personalize and customize offers to them in a way that we believe will drive, as it is, more units per transaction. And that's a good thing. So the way that we're thinking about our promotional tactics right now, I would say, is really not dramatic. These are small changes around the edges to learn about the sensitivity, and we're doing them at the time that the marketplace is maybe a little bit volatile and consumer sentiment is a little bit unpredictable. The good news is that we can ratchet back, which is what we've done, to our more traditional cadence. But I believe we've got the best tools that we've ever had to continue to test and learn. And we know that there's a lot of guests who -- there's a lot for them to discover at Ulta and a lot of products that, when we bring it to their attention via some of our e-mails and Beauty Breaks! and whatnot, we're seeing great response. So we'll continue to play with that and drive our growth.\nAram Rubinson: And just to follow up and recap this quarter, as far as I can tell, you did kind of hit your earnings target and you did hit your sales target, and you did have gross margins up with merchandise margins from the 10-Q saying that, that was kind of up 60 basis points. And your inventories weren't too out of whack. So I guess I'm just wondering as well, if you're doing any kind of bar setting as a new CEO coming in or -- because the numbers look good overall, at least for Ulta, to what you had issued in terms of guidance.\nMary N. Dillon: Well, that's an accurate reflection of our performance relative to guidance. And really, what we're doing today is just what we think is our best view of what to expect in the fourth quarter, given the environment as well as our preliminary view of 2014. Ulta is and will still continue to be a high-growth company, and the 2014 look that we're giving, which isn't guidance, but the early view, is still a very high-growth company. But it is different than what was stated before. I would say this isn't about bar setting, but it is about -- as Scott said and I said in my comments, this is also a great time for us just to take a step back and really create a 10-year view of Ulta. It's been a very successful company for many years, but like any business, the environment changes, whether it's the consumer environment, the categories we compete in, the competitive environment. So we really want to take a very thoughtful and deep view of our strategic planning. There's going to be plenty of choices we believe we have for future growth. We want to prioritize those and then come back with guidance based on that work.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Balter of Credit Suisse.\nGary Balter: Mary, the tone that we're hearing is different than on your last quarter. So is it -- could you walk us through kind of -- in the last 3 months or maybe it's longer than that, what are the elements within the company that you felt aren't executing, that require the investments that you're talking about that kind of say, let's slow the growth, let's reinvest, let's pull out with a better company? Where is the focus right now for where you need to make those investments?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, I guess I would say a couple of things. One is we're also in an environment that's changing and fluid in the marketplace. So as we said in the third quarter, we did see a change in our trend towards the end of the quarter, and we're reacting to that. So I feel very optimistic and upbeat about our prospects. And again, we're going to come out of this year with a very top performance in terms of top and bottom line. But it's somewhat different than what we would have guided, even really just coming in -- out of the -- in the middle of the second quarter. So that's different, and that would give us a reason to say let's look at our preliminary view of 2014 and provide the best transparency to that, that we can. Beyond that, I feel very optimistic about our future growth prospects. I'd say the only thing that's different is, as I learned about our business, I continue to be very optimistic. But I think we're going to have to be choiceful in terms of how we pick our spots for future growth. There's investments that will continue to be required as we look at a competitive environment that's increasingly omni-channel. Consumer views are changing, categories are evolving. So it's really not anything more than -- regardless of how this quarter performed, we would have been doing the strategic planning, frankly, and really want to come out in the future with our best view of what that future growth looks like. And I continue -- we very much expect Ulta to continue to be a high-growth, high-performance company. That stance has not changed.\nGary Balter: Okay. And just following up and then I'll get off, the -- you mentioned a few times, including in this answer, competitive environment is changing and got tougher. What -- could you be a little more specific on what's changed from expectations? Because everybody kind of expected a difficult Christmas period.\nMary N. Dillon: I was talking about [ph] more of a long term view which was that as we know that there's more people competing in beauty and really the need to be able to really operate in a very omni-channel environment, which is part of what our investment in our supply chain and ITs are going to allow us to do. In terms of the short term, I would just say, as we saw some impacts on our traffic -- I mean, our transactions, is that -- towards the end of the second quarter relative to our promotional changes, we felt that it's probably a little bit more promotionally sensitive than we might have thought going into the fourth quarter. But not dramatically so.\nOperator: The next question is from Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.\nEvren Dogan Kopelman: I wanted to ask in terms of the slowdown you saw at the end of the quarter, is it primarily a nail and fragrance category issue that you mentioned? Or did you see a slowdown in the growth rates of even the outperforming categories like the prestige skincare fragrance and salon?\nScott M. Settersten: Yes. Hey, Evren, a couple of data points again for people who follow the industry fairly closely. If you look back over the last couple of years, so 8 to 10 quarters, you would notice that both prestige and mass color cosmetic categories were really at the high-water mark at the end of fiscal 2011. So both of those categories were just into the double-digit year-over-year growth rates at that point in time, and they've both been on a slow deceleration over the course of the last 2 years so that we ended our Q3 -- I think mass color year-over-year was flat, and prestige color was low to mid-single-digits. So we're bucking those headwinds as well overall in our box besides the category -- the nail and the fragrance deceleration that has been talked about in the open marketplace here for the last couple of quarters. So there's a number of headwinds that we have category-wise that, to this point in time, we've been able to mitigate fairly well, even with the pullback on some of the promotional things that we're doing for the business. So people are curious as to the timing of things. Coming out of Q2, we felt really good about where we were. Our plans were working, we felt comfortable with where we were through the guidance phase of the last quarter's call. And really, this transaction trend went south on us late September and really heavily into October. So we're taking a really close look at that both from an internal view on what did we do that could have changed the guest perception or shopping patterns, or was it more macro kinds of things that have kind of stacked on top of each other here over time. So again, we're deep into the investigation process on all of those things, and you can -- rest assured, we're working hard to try to find the answer.\nEvren Dogan Kopelman: Great. That makes sense. The other question is your younger stores typically comp stronger than your older ones as the younger ones mature. Have you seen any changes to that historical trend? Or can we expect that to continue?\nScott M. Settersten: No. The comp stack for the third quarter is pretty similar to what we had back in the first quarter so you can remember back, we did a 6.7% all-in comp in the first quarter. We're doing a 6.80% or so. By and large, the stores look the same. Still the stores from 0 to 5 years, that comp ramp looks exactly the same as what's reflected in our model. When you get beyond year 5, years 6 through 15 is roughly in the -- it's in the solid low-single digit range. And then when you get beyond the 15-year range, it's more or less a net 0. So consistent with what we would expect at this kind of comp level. So again, we feel -- we're pleased with the 2013 slate of new stores and no change in the ramps.\nOperator: The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.\nIrwin Bernard Boruchow: I guess my question is the last time we heard from you, you were guiding a 5% to 7% comp for both Q3 and the year, which I think essentially implied a 5% to 7% comp for Q4. So to guide it now a 7% to 9% comp for Q4 with sales that are so far below the Street is just a little confusing. So I guess can you just help us understand the Q4 top line outlook and how does that compare to your view of what the Q4 sales number was going to be 3 months ago?\nScott M. Settersten: Yes. We tried to give you a realistic view of the business. Again, I mentioned in my prepared comments that there's 200 basis points in that 7% to 9%, Ike, that's really just a basic measurement, the arithmetic measure versus last year. So it's not really reflective of the core of the business. The core business is still operating at a 5% to 7%.\nIrwin Bernard Boruchow: But when we think about the outlook for Q4 coming down, is that a function -- I mean, you said more promotional environment. So obviously, margins lower than you had planned. But are the sales -- the total sales dollars, are those also -- where you're putting them now, are they lower than where you thought 3 months ago? Or is that not -- is that somewhat unchanged?\nScott M. Settersten: They are somewhat lower. I mean, we did see a dropoff in retail sales late in the third quarter, which we mentioned here, driven by transaction deceleration. So we have taken down our internal view of what we expect retail sales to be in the fourth quarter. So yes, that has been taken down somewhat.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Hofkin of William Blair.\nDaniel Hofkin: Just to follow up on that question, I guess still not completely clear. Like, where -- if you have -- I totally get that last year's comparison was affected by Sandy. That ought to benefit your comp growth and your total sales growth, it would seem, this year. So we're just trying to understand what appears to be, and again, maybe it's just the calendar shift that you described, but what appears to be a mismatch between the comp that you're projecting and the total sales growth, which has a much smaller spread relative to the comp than we're used to seeing. That's the first question.\nScott M. Settersten: Dan, I don't think I really have anything more to share on that one other than the 200 -- we're calling it 200 basis points roughly of the year-over-year comparison. And we have taken down our retail estimates, our retail comp estimates for the fourth quarter that are really -- really, it's the competitive environment and the conservative view that we're taking on the fourth quarter and what the margin rate investment is going to be to maintain those sales levels.\nDaniel Hofkin: So are you implying that you're expecting a moderation in new store performance or, let's say, non-comp store performance in the balance of the year that's maybe more significant?\nScott M. Settersten: No. I don't think so. I mean, our stores are continuing to perform at the levels that we expect them to. We may not see an overperformance kind of environment, like maybe that you've seen in the past or have been reflected in models just through the delivering of actual results. Historically, stores have -- our new store program has way overdelivered what our initial expectations were. So naturally, in an environment where comps are a bit more challenged, there's going to be some kind of headwinds on those new stores. I mean, they're not immune to what's going on with the macro consumer environment. So that might be a bit [indiscernible] if you're looking at it from a modeling perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew J. Fassler: First question I would ask, you talked about severance and some changes that you're making in supply chain and HR. Could you give us any more details on the changes that you made there?\nMary N. Dillon: Yes, sure. That was related to 2 changes at the executive team level in terms of the HR and the supply chain functions and just my judgment about capabilities that we needed there for the future. So we've got a great strong team here, we made a couple of changes and we're moving forward.\nMatthew J. Fassler: So, Mary, did you replace the senior executives in those roles with internal people at this stage?\nMary N. Dillon: One was internal and one was external.\nMatthew J. Fassler: Okay. My second question relates to the real estate plans. So this year, obviously, you were in the -- you're going to end up in the low to mid-20s. You were pretty close to that last year. And I guess in '11 and prior to that, I guess you had peaked at 15%, but that was sort of coming out of a downturn. So I guess as I combine the move to 15% next year with your discussion of developing urban and smaller store prototypes, what's your sense of the blue sky footprint potential for the existing format as you have it? And would you say that's changed at all from perhaps what you guys have talked about prior to the time you came to the company?\nScott M. Settersten: No, Matt. Our view is on the 1,200-store potential for our 10,000 square foot box. Nothing's changed with respect to any of that. Again, what we're faced with here in the near term, we think, is just -- it's whatever, a pendulum swing that will come and it will go, and consumer and category itself will bounce back here. Again, over the long term, we feel really good about our model and about the category overall. As we look at next year, it's really a balance. I think we've said before that 125 stores this year was kind on the outer reaches of what we felt like we could do comfortably, both supporting it with operating disciplines and training and all the other things we have to do with our new store associates. As we look to next year, we want to do a few more remodels, so that's kind of -- again, those are more or less like a new store, so that kind adds in -- gets you to your total buildout. And then there's a few more things internally that we want to do, kind of in-store projects with planogram changes in the mass area and a few other things we want to do. So all in all, we feel really comfortable with where we are, and it's more of a balanced approach next year.\nMatthew J. Fassler: Got it. And one last quick one. So if you think about the promotional environment, I guess, last year in the fourth quarter, the gross margin had a bit of a setback. It almost seems like there are other seasonal entrants into the business or some of your competitors choose to turn up the juice at this time of year. It seems to be a recurring pattern. Is it the year-round players who you find aggravating the competitive backdrop? Or are there more seasonal players, be it general merchants or others, who tend to refocus on this around holiday, who seem to be gumming up the works a bit from a margin perspective?\nScott M. Settersten: Well, one thing I do want to point out is that in the fourth quarter, even though we're guiding gross profits flat year-over-year, we are expecting merchandise margin to expand by roughly 50 basis points. So our plan of trying to balance the promotional environment here whilst continuing to drive a great value orientation for our customer is still in place. What we've seen here develop recently -- again, everybody sees this in the news, right? Our mailboxes are full every night, our e-mail accounts are full. We see the fashion and soft good guys out there with 50% off the whole store on the first week in a holiday. I mean, that -- nobody really expected that. I mean, we knew it was going to be competitive, but we didn't know it was going to be to this extent. So looking at it again objectively, in a balanced way, we said we need to compete here to maintain our gains. But when I think back -- and this is one of the benefits, I guess, for being around for a while, right? Thinking back, analogizing back to really -- the last time we saw discussions about inventory levels with these soft good players and the need to get through this stuff before the end of the holiday season was back in 2008, and that was a tough environment for everyone. And we'll take the same view this year as we did then, a balanced view between investing margin and chasing the comp number. So we'll be very mindful of that.\nMary N. Dillon: Yes. I just want to add one thing, which is that up until a recent shift in trend, these tweaks to our promotional strategy were encouraging to us. So in no way, shape or form did we step back from that as a longer-term way for us to continue to drive top line and bottom line, because we know we're getting smarter, we can test and learn. And yet, if the environment changed, we can respond to it. But we're going to continue to drive that over the long haul.\nOperator: The next question is from David Wu of Telsey Advisory Group.\nDavid Wu: First, in terms of next year's square footage guidance of 15% growth, which obviously -- that's at the low end of your long-term target range of 15% to 20%, and I understand that you're planning to do more remodels next year. But can you talk about whether -- or why you're not opening up more stores next year and if you're perhaps seeing any real estate limitations out there, and if you're still sort of sticking to your long-term 15% to 20% square footage growth target range?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, let me just start by saying that 125 stores this year, we've said, is probably about the peak in terms of really just executing with excellence. Every time we open up new stores, we do a great job identifying real estate and constructing those stores. We also have to hire folks and staff them and train them and have them ready for our guests. So we feel good about that number and really believe that, coming down off of that, is really just a way for next year to make sure that we're striking that right balance. We're not concerned about our ability to find the right real estate and to build those stores, and we're not concerned about the productivity of our store model. We just think this is a better pace for us right now.\nDavid Wu: Great. And can you talk more about your strategy for the brand boutiques, including your initial plans for next year and what the longer-term opportunity could be?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, as you know, we are really thrilled with the fact that our assortment continues to evolve. Our team here has done a great job partnering with really great vendors and iconic brands, and that's been part of the magic of Ulta, frankly. And it's great. So as I said in my prepared comments, we've gone to 100 Clinique store boutiques and 105 Lancôme boutiques this year, which is great. Benefit boutique doing exceptionally well, and we're going to continue to build out that strategy. So I can't tell you specifics today, but you can imagine that, that's high on our hit list of things to continue to build on.\nDavid Wu: Great. In terms of the higher promotions, are you expecting this to impact your non-prestige business? Or are you becoming more promotional also on the prestige side?\nScott M. Settersten: No. By and large, again, when we talk about promotions and discounting, that is non-prestige kind of business. So prestige product, that category, by and large, there is no discounting allowed. It's an SRP out the door.\nDavid Wu: Got it. So in terms of then the slower traffic and sales that you saw towards the tail end of September and into October, did that mainly impact then sort of the non-prestige side? Or did you also see a little bit of a pullback on prestige as well?\nScott M. Settersten: No. The promotions itself, it's generally non-prestige-related. Again, from time to time, prestige becomes part of the mix with some of the offers that we give our guests. But by and large, in the third quarter, it was non-prestige-related categories.\nDavid Wu: Where you saw the pullback?\nScott M. Settersten: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird.\nMark R. Altschwager: I wanted to touch a bit more on the supply chain side. Mary, I was hoping you could talk about your long-term vision there. You made some changes, so what is your assessment of the supply chain today? And where does it need to go in order to support the type of growth that Ulta is capable of?\nMary N. Dillon: Sure. Well, I -- we'll just answer that really at a macro level. But our supply chain today, I think, is performing very well for us, yet we know that we need to do more, especially because number one, we're a growing business. So we need more infrastructure to support our multi-year growth plans. We also know that we need to continually increase our ability to compete in an omni-channel way. So we're thrilled with our e-commerce performance, but we want to make sure that we have the capability at a minimum to be able to have our guests, for example, understand if they can order online and pick up in our stores. Whether or not we ship from stores is a different question, but we're really looking at the range of capabilities. And as I'm sure you imagine, that's not the -- you need to have the right systems in place to allow that kind of capability. And we also know that we have opportunities just in end-to-end efficiency in our supply chain. So we've taken some time to really build a robust view of that. We're -- the first stage of that is really building a new distribution center in 2015, which we're planning. But beyond that, there's also plans to invest in the right systems and in people and capability and capacity to support our long-term growth ambitions. We plan to get to 1,200 stores and continue to be a very high-growth retailer, so we need a supply chain that supports that.\nMark R. Altschwager: Okay. And then on the services side, where do you see the biggest opportunities? And how do you think about allocating the space in the store? And then as the environment gets more competitive, how do services fit with the long-term vision of building brand awareness and customer engagement?\nMary N. Dillon: Right. I think it's a perfect example of -- we sit back and think about our 10-year view of Ulta and how we want to really differentiate Ulta. That's exactly the kind of question we're asking ourselves. Ultimately, we really have a differentiated proposition today because of the one-stop shop ability, the exciting assortment that we offer, but also the fact that you can get services in our stores, which I don't think anybody can get online yet and hopefully never. But anyway -- so we've got a really differentiated concept that we believe is going to really be the place that allows us to win for the long term. So we're going to examine what we think about trends, consumer trends, anti-aging -- an example might be skin health, right? So there's ways that we can think about. Is there more we can do there? But that's just one example. But we'll put all those under the, I guess, sort of the examination lens here as we think about places that we'll continue to invest to grow. So -- but for sure, services will continue to be part of our long-term proposition.\nOperator: The next question is from Kayla Berg of Piper Jaffray.\nKayla Berg: First, if you would, could you share your thoughts about approaching holiday from a digital marketing perspective versus last year? And also, how do you guys feel positioned for holiday in fragrances here across the price points and newness?\nMary N. Dillon: Okay. Can I ask you guys to take those for us? Janet and Jeff, you want to take the marketing? We have our team here.\nJeffrey Severts: Sure. Well, Kayla, I would say that our digital marketing efforts will be pretty consistent with what you've seen from us for the balance of the year. So as we've talked through the first couple of quarters of the year, we're a lot more focused on the digital space than we have been traditionally, and you're just going to see that continue. Not going to give you much more detail than that because I'm sure the competition would love to hear it.\nJanet Taake: And in fragrance -- this is Janet. Basically, we have our exclusive gift with purchase that we started in November and continue through holiday, and that is exclusive to Ulta and something we have done for many, many years. And we're very excited. We've improved the quality of both of those. One has already been in the stores, and the second one hit this week actually. But we're also encouraged by some of the newness that we have seen at the end of third quarter. Just to comment on One Direction, out of the box was very strong, along with Honey from Mark Jacobs and a few other things. So gift sets are strong. And also, I think that we feel very good about some of the opening price points in purse sprays or roller balls, if you will. So from a fragrance perspective, we're ready for holiday.\nKayla Berg: Okay. And one last quick follow-up. Where do you guys expect to end the year in terms of inventory levels?\nScott M. Settersten: We expect to end the year in line -- similar to where we ended the third quarter. So it'll be well below what the comp increase is for the year. We feel very, very comfortable with our inventory position. Again, as many of you know, there's very little in the way of fashion risk in our inventory, so very low obsolescence risk. So again, very comfortable we're on plan and expecting to hit our targets at the end of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Krystyna Metcalf of Oppenheimer.\nKrystyna Metcalf: Most of my questions have already been asked, but I was just wondering if salon comps were still above product comps this quarter?\nScott M. Settersten: They were indeed. They were -- they added roughly...\nMary N. Dillon: 10 basis points.\nScott M. Settersten: 10 basis points to the comp for the quarter. So still performing very strong.\nKrystyna Metcalf: Great. And then I'm not sure if you answered this already, but I believe last quarter, you said that you were expecting e-commerce sales to go down just because of the new website rollout? And obviously, this quarter, they were pretty similar. So what are your expectations for 4Q?\nMary N. Dillon: Well, yes. We were very happy with that transition, and we were being cautious about that. So that's better than we expected. The first 3 quarters still, I would say, were benefiting from some pretty high-ticket products that we were selling that were hot products and -- I mean, supplements and some tools. We're excited about our continued growth, but the comps do get tougher going forward. So we're going to continue to grow. I'm not sure if we're citing a specific number, but it's -- we're going to continue to have tough comps, but we also feel more optimistic with the transition going better than it did, I might add.\nScott M. Settersten: And I would add, we picked up steam at the end of 2012 with our e-commerce site. They had a really good fourth quarter, so I wouldn't expect the 70% growth for the fourth quarter year-over-year.\nOperator: We have time for one more question from Jill Nelson of Johnson Rice.\nJill R. Caruthers: A quick one on fourth quarter gross margin. You did mention that merchandise margins are planned up. Could you talk about maybe the pressures in that line item you're expecting?\nScott M. Settersten: On the gross profit line?\nJill R. Caruthers: Yes, because you had said, for overall, it'd be flat.\nScott M. Settersten: Right. So we are happily expecting to see merchandise margin expansion with product mix and the prestige mix being richer as part of the overall business. We do have headwinds with fixed store cost. That's really the primary offset there, Jill. So it's really the accelerated new store program, especially with 125 new stores now kind of entering into the chain here late in the third quarter. So that's the headwind that's offsetting the merchandise margin gains.\nJill R. Caruthers: Okay. And then kind of big-picture question into 2014. Clearly, you need to put in more investments into the business. And could you maybe just talk about some of the big buckets? You've mentioned supply chain, but maybe if you could put them in order? Or just some type of magnitude of where you feel like the company has underinvested and what needs to help grow the business for -- into next year?\nScott M. Settersten: Yes. I wouldn't use the term underinvested, Jill. I mean, there is -- I think we've talked to many of you, at least I have, over the last year. Right? I mean, as a growing company, there's always things we'd like invest in, but you need to have the proper team in place and the proper third parties to help coach you along in some of these more complicated kinds of things. So I would just remind everyone, the biggest investment we're making is in the new store program. So big acceleration in 2012 and into 2013. And even next year, at 15%, 100 stores, do the arithmetic. That's no small feat for us. And that's still -- the best investment produces the best shareholder returns that we currently have. So in the current term though, that creates some headwinds for us on fixed store cost. Again, we don't get the leverage with all those stores going in place that we have in recent years, so that hurts us a bit. Some of the investments are more certain things. Mary talked about supply chain. We're going to get a lot of new capabilities there, which are going to be very helpful for us down the road. There's things in IT. Again, they're primarily customer-facing kinds of investments. So in-store POS systems that will allow us to do more mobile and all that kind of flashy iPad stuff, which everyone does now and we need to invest in as well. That's what the guests expects. There's other investments like brand awareness, marketing investments, training for store associates to make sure we give the right guest experience in places like skin category, which is high touch and high impact. So those things -- those are one of the things that we're talking about as part of the strategic planning process and how far do we need to go and to what extent do we need to do those kinds of things. So -- and then there are other things I'd call kind of compliance costs, non-investments, but will be a drag on earnings next year around health care. So some of that stuff is starting to kick in now. And I can tell you, generally speaking, it's more expensive than anybody really thought initially. So that's kind of the short bucket list for what we're looking at for 2014.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Dillon for any closing remarks.\nMary N. Dillon: In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates who worked very hard to deliver solid results in a tough environment in the third quarter. I'm very proud of the team for driving strong store sales while delivering on elements of our longer-term initiatives to position the company for success over the long haul. While we're acknowledging some of the challenges we're facing in the near term, I know the long-term opportunities for Ulta still make it one of the most exciting growth stories in all of retail. Thank you for your interest in Ulta Beauty, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tom Shaw, you may begin.\nThomas D. Shaw: Thanks, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's fourth quarter conference call.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.\nKevin A. Plank: Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone, from the brand-new Under Armour office here at New York City that just opened earlier this month. It's great to have a presence here at our new space in Chelsea, and we're looking forward to the opening of our first store in Soho later this spring. So Under Armour is a growth company, and with growth comes change. We like to say that Under Armour is a different company every 6 months, so we thought we'd start today by listing a few game changers that took place since we last spoke. First, despite starting the season unranked, Auburn University had 2 of the greatest comebacks in college football history, on its way to playing in the BCS National Championship Game. Then, we announced partnerships to outfit 2 of the most prestigious collegiate sports programs in the United States, the University of Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy. As someone here characterized it, we now have both God and country covered. Thirdly, we signed agreements to outfit 2 leading soccer clubs, Colo Colo in Chile and Cruz Azul in Mexico, as we lay the foundation for growth outside the United States in the world's biggest sports. Next, we signed our first ballerina. I can safely say those are 5 words I didn't picture myself saying on an earnings call when I started the business in '96. Misty Copeland of the American Ballet Theatre is a great illustration of how we will bring new dimensions to the Under Armour brand in 2014, as she helps us redefine what it means to be an athletic female. And finally, we made what we believe is a compelling first acquisition, MapMyFitness, which firmly positions us at the forefront of the exploding connected fitness movement. So a quarter with major new developments across our categories, geographies and business units. But fortunately, Q4 had a lot in common with the quarters that preceded it. It was our 15th consecutive quarter with net revenue growth of 20-plus percent and our 17th consecutive quarter with Apparel growth of 20-plus percent. As we said on our last call, our core North American Apparel business is strong, and that gives us the firepower to invest in growing new geographies with new categories and new consumers. So I just want to spend a minute this morning talking about an outstanding Q4 that capped an exceptional 2013, because it reinforces our strategy of investing in our growth drivers for the long term. I promised Brad I'd let him deliver most of the good news of the quarter, but I want to stress that the 35% top line growth we saw in Q4 was driven by strength across the board in all of our businesses. We certainly saw some benefit to our Fleece and ColdGear in the quarter from the weather, and Brad can talk to that in a bit, but the sales momentum was evident in both our wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer business with Apparel growing 35%; Footwear, 24%; and Accessories, 52%. That continued momentum in our North American Apparel business is a great testament to our ability to develop large-scale platforms around our relentless flow of innovation. For example, in the third quarter, we introduced our latest Apparel innovation, ColdGear Infrared, our industry-leading technology that provides warmth without the weight and enables us to exceed our consumers' expectations around cold weather protection. With a strong launch in 2013, including solid holiday sales across Men's and Women's wearing pieces, we will start to see even more meaningful volume for ColdGear Infrared in 2014. Our ability to expand platforms is a critical piece of how we are driving growth. In year 2, we'll bring the ColdGear Infrared into new categories much as we did with both Charged and Storm Cotton, which last year, in just year 3, topped $300 million in combined revenues. This category of Charged and Storm Cotton did not even exist before 2011, just 3 years ago. I mentioned the strength of our Apparel business was across-the-board, and I want to quickly cover Women's and Youth. Coming off of a year of outstanding results in Women's, we are extremely excited about what we planned for 2014. In addition to the great product that is in the pipeline and our improved presentation at retail, including our New York store that opens this spring here in Soho, we will be focusing our second Brand Holiday this year on Women's. One of the reasons we are so bullish on our Women's business is that there has been a quiet shift going on, where women are increasingly wearing \""athletic product\"" outside of the gym. We think the reality is this shift is more permanent than some may expect, as our female consumer continues to embrace our technology innovation and increase focus on style. We are in a great position to continue to grow this business as we build a loyal base of athletes and are growing with her as she moves into new categories and end-users for Under Armour product. We had an extremely strong 2013 in Youth, or as we refer to them, Next. Our Youth business has exceeded all of our expectations, and we continue to see momentum across not just Apparel, but also Footwear and Accessories as well. For the year, Youth doubled the growth rate we saw in our Men's and Women's Apparel businesses. This broad-based strength gives us great confidence in our long-term future as we remain laser-focused on maintaining the strong relationship with our consumer as he and she move into new sports and new wearing opportunities as they grow up. All in all, it was an exceptionally strong year for our Apparel business in North America. We created a lot of excitement in the market with our Alter Ego and ColdGear Infrared innovations, and have unprecedented momentum in our core Apparel business as we enter 2014. On the Footwear side of the business, we also enter the new year with great momentum as we start telling the story of SpeedForm to consumers today with a presence some of you may have seen on your TV [ph] this morning. We will launch holiday 1 and tell the SpeedForm story with our largest events marketing execution to date, taking over Grand Central Station's Vanderbilt Hall starting today and lasting through Super Bowl Sunday night. The SpeedForm Apollo running shoe is the latest innovation from Under Armour Footwear, and it destroys the rules of footwear construction. We craft each of these lightweight shoes in a clothing factory to create the precision, feel, fit and comfort consumers have come to expect from our Apparel. And when the March issue of Runner's World magazine hits next week, the SpeedForm Apollo will be recognized by their editors as best debut in its spring shoe guide. The TV campaign starts February 22 but available on YouTube this afternoon, and we're incredibly excited to bring the level of innovation we've already brought to cleated to the running community starting with the SpeedForm Apollo. That focus on exceeding our consumers' expectations was part of the driving force behind our decision to purchase MapMyFitness in December. We have a very simple mission here at Under Armour, and it's to make all athletes better. The amount of information now available to athletes to help them achieve that has never been greater and also never more complex. With our acquisition of MapMyFitness and the leadership of its founder, Robin Thurston, we are now in great position to design open digital products to the athlete of tomorrow and provide solutions that will help people across the world lead healthier lifestyles. Because we think connected fitness is about more than a bracelet that enables you to tell your social media friends that you walk 1.2 miles today. It's about the opportunity to innovate technology in a seamless way that empowers the athlete individually benefit from the wealth of information that is going to be available to them. It's about waking up and knowing that even though you were thinking of running 3 miles this morning, your quality of sleep and other biometric measures suggest you'd get more benefit from running 4. We know that this world is still in a very early stage of development, and we believe the addition of Robin and his team of more than 60-plus engineers and developers meaningfully accelerates our profile in the digital space. We have been learning every single day since the acquisition in December. I don't want to get into the operational details at this point, but I can tell you the integration between our team in Baltimore and the MapMyFitness team in Austin has been rapid and productive, and each day brings new ideas and possibilities to what connected fitness will mean to Under Armour. So let me give you some scope on the size of the opportunity. MapMyFitness has built a community of over 21 million registered users. And during just the first week of January, we added more than 400,000 new users from the 1st to the 7th. Equally important is that this acquisition immediately brings us the talent we need to leapfrog into a leadership position in the world of connected fitness. We're incredibly excited to join forces with Robin and his team and believe we will drive the future performance innovation for the world's athletes. So what to watch for, for Under Armour in 2014 because, like I said at the top, we are a different company every 6 months. In the short term, you will continue to find us on the world stage of sport. For example, in golf this past weekend, at The Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines, there were 3 different leaders at the end of rounds 2, 3 and 4, and each of them, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland and Scott Stallings were outfitted in Under Armour. And next week, when the Olympics open in Sochi, we'll unveil the culmination of our partnership with Lockheed Martin, the world's fastest speed skating suit, that will be worn by Shani Davis and other members of the U.S. speed skating team. We will also be on stage outfitting U.S. bobsled and the Canadian snowboard team, amongst others. In the longer term, our goal is to continue doing what we do, investing to ensure we are building the foundation for long-term growth while delivering results now. MapMyFitness, Notre Dame and Navy and partnerships with companies like Lockheed Martin are all part of that plan. We are well on track to meet the goals we set out at Investor Day in June 2013. But our ambition extends well beyond $4 billion in revenue by 2016, and our ambition is fueled by investments. Some large and immediately relevant, like Notre Dame, and others that are small now but could potentially ignite our business down the road, because for every Notre Dame or Navy deal, there's a much smaller investment we're making somewhere else in the business. It may be a logistics tool that you'll never hear about, a retail store in Mexico or an up-and-coming athlete who may one day become the next Stephen Curry or Tom Brady. When we invest well, we win. We believe our 2013 results are a great reflection of sound investments and solid execution. We are a growth company, one that's focused on our future but delivering results right now. With that, I'll turn it over to Brad. Brad?\nBrad Dickerson: Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results, followed by our updated outlook for 2014. Our net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 35% to $683 million, representing our fastest growth rate in the past 9 quarters. For the full year, net revenues increased 27% to $2.33 billion, which compares to our most recent full year guidance of $2.26 billion. Apparel grew 35% to $546 million during the quarter from $405 million in the prior year, representing the 17th straight quarter of at least 20% growth for our largest product category. As a reminder, we grew Apparel 25% in the fourth quarter of 2012 despite facing the headwinds of warm seasonal weather and poor service levels in key areas like Fleece. This year, we came into the quarter with a compelling lineup of product, including expanded Fleece and UA Tech offering, as well as our new ColdGear Infrared technology. This new product position -- positioning, combined with the tailwinds of cold weather and our ability to better service the business with higher fill rates, allowed us to more fully capitalize on the strong demand from our consumers. From a product category standpoint, training continues to drive much of our overall Apparel dollar growth. We also saw strong growth during the period in our running, hunting and mountain categories, in our Women's Studio line and across our Youth business. Our Direct-to-Consumer net revenues increased 36% for the quarter, representing approximately 39% of net revenue, which was the same mix as the prior-year period. In our retail business, we opened 5 new Factory House stores during the fourth quarter, increasing our North America Factory House store base to 117, up 15% from 102 locations at the end of last year's fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded 9 of our existing locations during the year, in part, to offer a broader product assortment in areas such as Footwear and Women's. Looking at our full-priced brand house stores, we opened our second location at Tysons Corner near Washington, D.C. in November. In E-Commerce, we believe many of the same factors that contributed to our strong Apparel growth also drove better-than-planned results in this channel. Fourth quarter Footwear net revenues increased 24% to $55 million from $45 million in the prior year, representing approximately 8% of net revenues for the period. Results for the quarter include the timing of Footwear liquidations, which were higher than planned. Given this action, we believe we are entering 2014 better positioned in the market for our new product offerings this spring. Our Accessories net revenues during the fourth quarter increased 52% to $65 million from $43 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by headwear and gloves. International net revenues increased 9% to $37 million in the fourth quarter and represented 5% of total net revenues. Moving on to margin. Fourth quarter gross margins expanded approximately 100 basis points to 51.3% compared to 50.3% in the prior year's quarter. We previously guided fourth quarter gross margins to decline year-over-year. On the positive side, we expected lower airfreight and a lower mix of excess at our Factory House channel. We expected these to be more than offset by the negative impacts of resourcing Fleece [ph], higher Canadian duties and currency impacts on our Japanese business. As the quarter concluded, we experienced minimal impact from both resourcing and Canadian duties. In addition, we drove improved profitability through higher service levels and better-than-planned performance across our Direct-to-Consumer channels. Looking at the year-over-year gross margin picture, the following factors contributed to the improvement during the quarter. First, our sales mix was favorable, partially offset by the higher Footwear liquidations in the quarter. These factors contributed to approximately 90 basis points of gross margin improvement. Second, the favorable airfreight expenses benefited gross margins by approximately 60 basis points. Partially offsetting these gains, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 20 basis points. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue deleveraged 270 basis points to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 34.2% in the prior year's period. With our strong results for the quarter, we had higher-than-planned incentive compensation expenses. This includes approximately $11 million in equity incentive compensation, which we had forecasted in 2014. These higher incentive compensation expenses were a significant driver of the overall SG\u0026A deleverage for the quarter. Further details around our 4 SG\u0026A buckets are as follows. First, marketing costs decreased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 9.7% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by overall expense leverage given our strong top line performance. Second, selling costs increased to 11.6% of net revenues for the quarter from 10.7% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the growth in our Direct-to-Consumer business. Third, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 8.9% of net revenues for the quarter from 7.6% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expenses and innovation investments. Finally, corporate services decreased (sic) [increased] to 7.5% of net revenues for the quarter from 6.2% in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expenses and approximately $2.5 million in closing costs for the MapMyFitness acquisition. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $98 million compared with $82 million in the prior-year period. For the full year, operating income increased 27% to $265 million compared to our most recent full year guidance of $260 million. Operating margin contracted 170 basis points during the quarter to 14.4%, while holding flat for the full year at 11.4%. Our fourth quarter tax rate of 34% is favorable to the 37.1% rate last year, primarily driven by the timing of state tax credits, which were received in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our full year effective tax rate of 37.8% was higher than the 36.7% effective rate for 2012, primarily due to increased international investments driving reduced profitability overseas. Our net income in the fourth quarter increased 28% to $64 million compared with $50 million in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.59 compared to $0.47 last year. Full year diluted earnings per share increased 24% to $1.50 compared to $1.21 in 2012. Now moving over to the balance sheet. Total cash and cash equivalents at year-end increased 2% to $347 million compared with $342 million at December 31, 2012. We funded the $150 million purchase of MapMyFitness in the fourth quarter with $50 million of cash and a $100 million draw from our $300 million revolving credit facility. Inventory at year-end increased 47% to $469 million compared to $319 million at December 31, 2012, reflecting the same factors we outlined during our third quarter conference call related to comparisons to our prior year supply chain delivery challenges. Our investment in capital expenditures was approximately $36 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $92 million for 2013. We are currently planning 2014 capital expenditures in the range of $140 million to $150 million, primarily driven by incremental investments to support our Direct-to-Consumer and International businesses as we further develop and expand our global office footprint. Now moving on to our updated outlook for 2014. Based on current visibility, we expect 2014 net revenues of $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion, representing growth of 22% to 23%, and 2014 operating income of $326 million to $329 million, representing growth of 23% to 24%. This expected growth is in line with the long-term growth rates laid out at our Investor Day last June. Below [ph] operating results, we anticipate higher interest expense in 2014, given the financing of the MapMyFitness acquisition, the full year effective tax rate of 39% and fully diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the range of 109 million to 110 million. Given these full year parameters, we'd like to provide a few more details on how we currently see the quarterly change playing out. First, with net revenues. We currently anticipate the growth rate for the first half of the year to be above our expected full year growth rate. Factors driving this include our expected ability to continue servicing our business with higher fill rates, as well as accelerated Footwear growth. For the second half of the year, we will start to comp the improved service levels experienced in the second half of 2013. In addition, over the next few months, we will gain more visibility on fall-winter orders and our ability to execute on the planned international growth in the back half of the year. We will provide updates on our progress on future calls. Next on gross margins, where we expect modest gains throughout each quarter in 2014, inclusive of lapping onetime factors in 2013 such as the third quarter import duty impact. While we see numerous puts and takes in individual quarters, 4 factors are expected to be the common themes during the year. First, we expect ongoing supply chain efficiencies to be the primary driver to higher gross margins. Second, we expect minimal margin impact from our Direct-to-Consumer business given lower Factory House square footage growth year-over-year, as well as a similar mix of made-for product in our Factory House stores year-over-year. Third, our sales mix will be adversely impacted by our expected international growth, which includes a mix of lower margin distributor businesses. Finally, Footwear growth is expected to have a minimal impact to consolidated gross margins as the expected sales mix impact is now planned to be offset by improved Footwear product margin. Shifting to SG\u0026A. As we mentioned, we recognized approximately $11 million in incentive compensation expense during the fourth quarter of 2013 that was originally forecasted in 2014. As a result, we are reallocating investments in 3 primary areas for 2014: marketing, international and MapMyFitness. In marketing, we expect to deleverage expenditures to approximately 11% of net revenues for the full year given some of the initiatives Kevin laid out before. From a timing perspective, we expect over 100 basis points of deleverage in the first quarter, primarily given our overall plans around activating our first Brand Holiday of the year. The marketing expense rate is planned to remain elevated in the second quarter before normalizing from a rate perspective during the second half of the year. International remains an important opportunity and priority, and we will continue to make the right level of investments to help realize our global potential, especially in Latin American markets that we are entering in 2014. MapMyFitness will also be a key area of investment as we look to build and further engage this community. As we have been emphasizing, our bottom line focus will remain on driving operating income dollar growth balanced with making the right investments to drive our long-term global success. Finally, some additional color on our inventory positioning. We expect the inventory growth rate to remain above the net revenues growth rate at the end of the first quarter given some of the same factors we outlined during this past quarter and including our positioning for elevated first half growth expectations. We do expect the spread between the inventory growth rate and the net revenues growth rate to narrow somewhat during the first quarter before returning to more in-line levels during the duration of the year. We remain encouraged with some of the early traction we are seeing from the recent investments across our supply chain organization. In conclusion, we had a great finish to 2013, with strong signs of continued brand momentum, improving supply chain efforts to better service this demand and improved foundations to support long-term global success. These factors give us the confidence in raising our 2014 top line outlook by over $100 million from our preliminary outlook last quarter, while also raising our 2014 operating income outlook by over $10 million. We'd now like to open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Saad of ISI Group.\nOmar Saad: Two questions. Firstly, real quick, do you guys have a sense for how much the cold weather contributed to that really big sales acceleration in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up on DTC.\nBrad Dickerson: Sure, Omar. On the cold weather question, we had talked last year, last year, we had a warm winter in the fourth quarter and we still grew 25%. And we've been talking about that the impact of weather is less and less in our organization as our product line evolves. So 5, 6, 7 years ago, cold weather would have had a significant impact, either upside or downside, in our business. But our products have evolved so much, and it's much more diversified now, especially with our Fleece offering, that cold weather has a little bit less of an impact than it did 6, 7 years ago. So just as a warm winter in Q4 last year didn't have a huge downside to us because we grew 25%, it didn't have a huge upside to us in our 35% either. That being the case though, we definitely realize that there's some tailwind to weather, and it makes our results a little bit better across our channels, wholesale and DTC. So there was definitely an upside. Quantifying the upside to the fourth quarter is a little tough to do when you're growing 35%, but you could easily say maybe a couple of percentage points of was due to cold weather.\nOmar Saad: Brad, that's really helpful. And then, Kevin, DTC, it looks like it approached 40% on the business in the fourth quarter. That's pretty amazing from where you were 5, 6 years ago. Can you talk about what you're learning, maybe from the Tysons Corner store, the Baltimore store? You're in New York, you're coming into the New York downtown. Is the product different than what you're offering at wholesale? Is it more premium? And the way you flow in product to generate more newness and innovation, can you maybe talk about some of the strategies around the new full-price stores?\nKevin A. Plank: Yes, well, we're celebrating our 1-year anniversary of opening the brand house in Baltimore, and we opened it in a place that wasn't exactly a retail destination and just see what we could learn. We -- I think the learnings of the last 12 months have told us a few things. Number one, that we got a premium brand that there is a position that the consumer is looking for. There is product that we offer in the brand that maybe they haven't found in an easier basis at retail. I think the #1 goal that we have with this was making it a more compelling experience for our customer base and having our wholesale distribution as well recognized, that we could be much bigger and broader than maybe they positioned us and sort of putting us in a bit of a box in some of the retails that we've had before. Great examples of that, I think, is the way we've been able to obviously expand Men's, but Women's is probably the biggest thing, the openness of color. Things like our StudioLux line is where customers are coming from all over the country, in fact [ph], all over the world, and saying, \""Wow, this is a full-line brand\"" versus maybe just seeing a few items, which is I think we've gotten pinned into that in the past. So Tysons is something where we then said, it was just something in our backyard. We expanded at Tysons. We're seeing similar results there. We're outpacing the way that perform at the stores. And so it's doing incredibly well. And we're going to learn a lot when we come up to New York City. And I think it will be refreshing because there's not [ph] a people in this market that I don't believe have gotten a great Under Armour experience walking into some of our stores here. So I'd say that as a challenge to our wholesale partners and also as an opportunity for ourselves. And so having retail gives us the ability to be strategic and be thoughtful, and I think we're learning. There's no plan in place right now to say we're looking to roll out 25 or 50 or 100 units. I think we're going to take them one store at a time. We're going to look for key markets where we can be strategic, places that we want to enter, and we're going to continue to learn. So I think we have the ability to change the model as to how people have done it in the past, a, not being just a retailer, not just being a wholesaler but there's a great balance in the middle, and ideally, we're inspiring our wholesale distribution to take on more comprehensive Under Armour presentation in their own stores.\nOmar Saad: International maybe for one of these new stores?\nKevin A. Plank: Yes. No, it's the same thing. You look at markets that we have around the globe and just take China for instance. We've got 13 stores total in 2013. We'll be growing over 50 stores by the end of 2014 as well. We're adding over 40 stores globally outside the United States as well. So we -- this really has served as much a sort of a brand marker and not something that's just domestic. It absolutely has as much to do with our global footprint and our global growth as anything. So ideally, what you'll see is consistency. You'll see a consistent message from what you find in Baltimore to Tysons to New York, and then what you find in Mexico City or in Shanghai or any place else where we're opening an Under Armour brand now.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy of Stifel.\nJim Duffy: Kevin, people really seem to like your brand.\nKevin A. Plank: We'll take it.\nJim Duffy: I'm intrigued by your Women's Brand Holiday. Are you willing to share a preview of the direction and timing for that? Then I have a follow-up on MapMyFitness.\nKevin A. Plank: We're just getting going with launching Holiday One this afternoon, so we're pretty focused on what Footwear is going to be. So if you don't mind, I'm going to turn that into, I think, more of a Footwear approach than anything. The answer, though, briefly, I think Women's deserves it. We don't give a lot of credit for our Women's business today. Even still, yet it's approaching over $500 million. We crossed $500 million in 2013, and our Women's business is really beginning to take hold with us as a company. We find out again that when we do innovate, we win. And our Women's business is no different than that. And so, I think it's earned the right and it's earned the focus that you're going to see of a committed organization that has 3 massive events a year, and Women's is going to have a second event during the back-to-school campaign. So that's going to be a big deal for us.\nJim Duffy: Great, look forward to that. MapMyFitness, a great category. Heretofore, they've had a device-agnostic approach. Looking forward, how are you and Robin thinking about evolving that Switzerland position? Will there be a more brand-exclusive approach at some point in the future?\nKevin A. Plank: Yes. No, I don't see that. If I could, let me take a minute and just tell you about MapMyFitness and the way that we've approached the category. We haven't had a chance, I think, to speak to the market about what our mindset was when we made the acquisition back in December. So first of all, as a great brand, which I think we're continuing to underscore, [indiscernible] mentioned at the top of the Q\u0026A as well, again, is that we've got a chance to go in a lot of different directions and a lot of different categories. And so, the most difficult thing we have is editing where do we want to go. A while ago, we identified Connected Fitness as the future of sport, a place where frankly, Under Armour has to be because we see the commitment from our consumer to want to be there also. Measurement and information, it's critical to making athletes better, which is our core mission statement. So it was important enough [ph], and we looked at the space and we spent some time looking at the categories. But I'll be honest, I was a user of the MapMyFitness app for more than 2 years, so I was incredibly familiar with it. And Robin and I have had a few conversations just about entering the space, and I just gave them feedback and comments mostly just as a consumer, but then also putting my Under Armour hat and thinking, \""Wow, what would this mean for us?\"" We looked at 3 basic criteria when we decided, are we going to pick a partner here? Are we going to make an acquisition or are we going to try to go it alone? And frankly, we've almost been doing that with our Armour39 product that we launched back in January of 2011 at the NFL Combine. What was important to us was community size, the openness, the platform. To reference specifically your questions, so absolutely not. We want to be agnostic, and we want to be open to all. And then third and most importantly to us is leadership. With 21 million registered users today, MapMyFitness is an incredible asset, MapMyRun, MapMyRide. And more importantly, I mentioned that stat during my script, in the first week of January, they added an additional 400,000 users, which is up -- really, I think was up over 80% to 100% from the prior year. So we're beginning to see this accelerator that's happening. Secondly, being a platform that works with more than 400 different devices, I'm not sure that Under Armour wants to bet on the hardware side of this world. I think there's too much innovation, there's too many players. I'm not sure who's going to win, and we're not willing to throw our hat in the ring there either. And we've done it with Armour39. We think we can -- we think we have the best product there. We think we can be incredibly competitive. But from a wearables standpoint, we'd rather sit back, and we'd rather find out who the winners are going to be, and then we'll -- we could partner with them. And more importantly, we can get the trust from our consumer to make the appropriate recommendations about whoever best in class without having a jilted interest of it being ourselves. And third and most importantly, bringing Robert on. We've struggled with this, Gary [ph]. I don't think [ph] struggling would have to be a fair word, but we've looked at how can we become more relevant in digital as a whole. And going, frankly, from the word digital to the world's connected fitness is an area that now we have a leader in Robin Thurston, who's one of the founders of this industry, who's going to be driving the digital Connected Fitness space for Under Armour as a whole and bringing with him a team of more than 60 now, just with the hirings in the last 2 months, more than 70 different engineers and developers that we have on the team down in Austin, we're going to keep that headquarters there. We're going to build that technology base for us, and it's something that we think gives us great legs to grow on. Understanding the athlete of -- we've got a user base now of more than 20 million people that understands the habits, the routine. It's amazing when you balance the fact that when someone goes for a run, some people go for 2 miles and some people go for 4 miles. But when you aggregate 20 million people and find out the average run is 3.1 miles, it's one of those things that's saying how can we learn information from that. And probably the last thing I'd say about this space, globally, this thing is only in English today. And so, one of the approaches that Robin and the team have -- and I was doing a tour through Latin America, actually, as we're going and finishing the acquisition. And it was amazing just sitting in Brazil and dropping Robin an email and saying, \""How many in Brazil?\"" And it's 100,000 in Brazil.\"" And the site's not even translated into Portuguese, let alone Spanish. 2 million in U.K, 600,000 in Australia of all places, 50,000 in Mexico. So we're quickly going down the road of translation, quickly going to use this to help us with our international growth and footprint also. So we're incredibly excited about the deal, everything. And first blush [ph] and again [ph], we're are still on honeymoon stage, but everything's going incredibly well, and we're really optimistic at what this is gaining [ph] for Under Armour in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nRobert F. Ohmes: I have one question. I was hoping that we could get you to sort of elaborate on Under Armour's dot-com strategy and maybe start with I think with the fourth quarter of last year, you guys had a few website transition issues, some weak conversion rates. Can you maybe start by talking about how your website business has been in the fourth quarter and then how you foresee it in 2014? And also, maybe help us understand maybe a little bit more how Under Armour thinks as a brand about the growth of its website versus the growth of Under Armour on other websites like the dot-com-only players like Amazon as well as some of your key partners like Dick's Sporting Goods. I think it'd be helpful for all of us.\nBrad Dickerson: Robbie, this is Brad. I'll jump on the front half of that question, if you don't mind, on the dot-com kind of numbers in Q4 and how it relates to '14. So yes, you're right, we had some challenges last year on conversion and all that kind of common metrics on the E-Commerce side last year versus this year. We saw some pretty significant improvements. So that's really a testament to the E-Commerce team during the course of the year getting the site where it needs to be, getting ready for obviously the heavy traffic we expect in Q4. Q4, obviously, is a huge part of the year for us in the E-Commerce side. So we saw pretty much across-the-board that key metrics around traffic, conversion, average order value are really looking in our favor in Q4 year-over-year. That was part of the obvious upside to the fourth quarter. Again, going back to my comment before, we -- a couple of comments before, we serviced our business much better year-over-year. There's no doubt the E-Commerce business benefited from that. We talked a little bit about the tailwind of weather, which we think obviously helped a little bit also. And then I think just in general for our brand, this is an E-Commerce statement, it's also a statement for overall brand, is looking back 90 days, we performed much better in the fourth quarter in a full price -- at full price for our brand compared to what was a very heavily promotional environment, too. So coming out of that, beyond our expectations, that also helped the E-Commerce side in the fourth quarter. Looking at 2014, this is also, I've got to comment, E-Commerce also the rest of our business, as we roll out of this great fourth quarter we just had, looking at it, and we're really a couple of weeks into this kind of gathering of data, looking at it and saying what does it mean for Q4 next year and the back half of the year. Again, E-Commerce is heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, so our teams are still kind of working through that, what's the right level of expectation in the fourth quarter for us coming off this great fourth quarter this year. But the good news here is that the metrics, again, conversion, traffic conversion, average order value, all seem to be working in the right direction for us year-over-year. But with Jason LaRose on board now, our new leader, we are really focused not just on the good results we're having right now but what do we do in 2015 and beyond to keep this momentum going. And maybe I'll let Kevin jump on top of that one.\nKevin A. Plank: Yes, I think the best place to start with this, and Brad just hit on it, is leadership, plain and simple. The addition -- it's unfortunate that I think we've gotten a bit of a reputation about executives in our team, but we don't get [ph] the press release 2 times, the ones that are doing so well for us. So we made 2 key additions last year. We had several but 2 I'll highlight is on the Direct-to-Consumer side. Number one, Susie McCabe running our retail division, who came to us from Polo, Ralph Lauren; And then Jason LaRose, who's heading up E-Commerce. And so, again, while they're both in that 120-, 160-day opening window, I think the leadership changes are something that's been incredibly significant. And you're going to see that as we begin to, I think, grasp the fact that this community is growing in an amazingly fast way. Mobile for us today is 40% of our business, to ua.com, and I think if go back 2 or 3 years, it was like 3%. So we're quickly, I think, modifying and adjusting ourselves to a mobile world and what that means. And also, what Jason is doing is building out our International E-Commerce team. He's taken some of our best and brightest talent that we have in the company and focusing them on our International E-Commerce and doing that for Charlie Maurath and what we're doing on a global basis. I don't know if the model's been written as to how we're supposed to go about being a global company. And so, getting translation, becoming local in markets. And again, this is much bigger than just putting a site up in German. I mean, the supply chain, the logistics, all the components, we -- the system side of it. Another thing to call out on the leadership side, we just hired a new CIO, a gentleman named Chris Gates, who joins us from GE Lighting, and Chris is one of those guys who's going to help us understand the global footprint because when I -- again, when I say website, it's so much more than just having a site that translates in a local language. And so, we feel like we're just getting started here. We feel that E-Com, it's not earth shattering by any stretch. It, obviously, is the future. And it means that we don't feel that we have to go to a market and open 3,000 stores in order to be relevant there, it's that we can use the Web as something to be thoughtful and strategic with it and also to test grounds and to find out how developed we are. And so, we're going to have a little bit of balance. It's something that consumers can walk into stores and feel and touch. And then we're also going to understand that Black Friday wasn't about jumping into a crowded mall as much this year. There were a lot of people who stayed home and shopped on their laptops this year. So I think we're open to all those things. I think our partners, at the same time, Robbie, to sort of address that, are looking at it the same way. We've got a few key partners. I think this space is still evolving in a really fast way when you think about the pure players that are out there also. Our partners and Dick's is -- were looking for ways, particularly the MapMyFitness acquisition also, is Robin and his team are looking and how can we help the category and what can we do for Dick's Sporting Goods, how can we drive Foot Locker and Macy's and how can we help our key partners, some of the traffic that we can drive and some of the use that we'll be seeing from traffic coming through ua.com or the MapMyFitness platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.\nLindsay Drucker Mann: Brad, I wanted to ask you just a couple of questions. Number one, if you could help maybe put some numbers around the improvement in fill rates, when that started to happen, how much better you guys have gotten and whether you think there's more to go? And then secondly, if you could talk just a little bit about more broadly on the supply chain where you talked about strides that you've made and how encouraged you feel about the go-forward, just some of the specific areas where you've see an improvement in metrics that they have?\nBrad Dickerson: Sure. On the fill rates side, yes, definitely saw improvements coming into the back half of the year, especially, as we worked through some of the issues that we had last year in the back half of the year. So fill rates in general were improving as we worked through the back half of the year. In the fourth quarter, in general, if you looked at kind of our normal fill rate by cancel date, we were probably in about the mid-80s in the fourth quarter last year, and this year we're much closer to the mid-90s. So like I said in my prepared remarks, definitely a tailwind there and help from our supply chain side of servicing the business much better year over year. We do see those fill rates stabilizing here as we get into the front half of the year. As I've always said, the supply chain is a very complex area. There's always going to be challenges here and there. But in general, we see fill rates stabilizing in the front half of the year and again comping -- again, we were improving our fill rates last year in the front half of the year. But really, more towards the back half of the year is where they kicked in. So we'll see a little bit of a benefit from that in the front half of the year, too, as we work through the first 6 months of 2014. In general, supply chain, a lot of things here. It's people, it's process, it's systems. A lot of additional leadership coming on board. Since Jim Hardy came on board 2 years ago, he's bringing additional leaders, putting people in the right places. That helps, again, getting more discipline and processes around how we buy inventory and how we demand -- how we forecast the demand of revenues going forward. We talked a lot about in our Investor Day and in previous earnings calls around the 3-year planning process and the huge benefit that should have to our supply chain longer term as we can get out ahead of our design development time frame and we'll be able to predict capacity more efficiently and the timing of the need of demand also. So those will be things that -- the 3-year planning process is rolling into its second year right now. You should start to see some benefit of that as we probably start working towards the back half of this year but even more so in 2015. We did talk about some system changes we've done on the supply planning side last year, the demand planning side this year and with the regional [ph] agility planning systems. We're seeing some of the benefits of the supply system we put in place last year. We're still working through implementation on the demand side this year. So again, we should start to see more benefit to get to the back half of this year and into '15. So overall, I'd say a little ahead of schedule. Still have some challenges to work through, and Jim would be the first one to admit that, I'm sure. But we're really pleased with where we are right now compared to where we were about 18 months ago and definitely on track to be ahead of where we thought we'd be over the course of the next couple of years.\nKevin A. Plank: And also, just jumping on the end of that, and look we had a banner quarter, and hats off really to our entire team. But I think it's important as we call out things, and Jim Hardy is now 2 years in the job and Chris Gates, who just got here 5 minutes ago, and the foundation that was laid by the balance of our team and guys like Jody Giles and Mike Fafaul that really laid the foundation for our organization to run forward like this. So any way, I just want to give a great shout out to those guys and the entire supply chain team, who has built and put this -- made this kind of opportunity available to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon of Canaccord.\nCamilo R. Lyon: Kevin, you talked about some pretty great innovations over the last year, SpeedForm Apollo, ColdGear Infrared. I wanted to hear your thoughts on zippers.\nKevin A. Plank: Right. You must have been out at the outdoor retail event.\nCamilo R. Lyon: I was, yes.\nKevin A. Plank: Look, I think it's -- speaking about product, one thing that we found is that when we innovate, that we win. You're seeing it happen on the Apparel side. You're not beginning, but you're continuing to see it happen on the Footwear side, but that's the kind of volumes that we've approached on Apparel. What we found out from 2013 was that things like introducing ColdGear Infrared, and we thought that we'd see really large gains in that product coming in 2014 and that has big plans and had a lot to do with the growth that we saw in 2013, and beginning with the fact the product just works. And it's -- this ceramic print that we have, and there's a lot more technical that goes into it than just that, but it's a terrific product that is great. Charged and Storm Cotton I mentioned on the -- in my script earlier. It didn't exist before 2011. Today, it will be over $300 million business. The things like Alter Ego that we got up and down just inside of a year, so introducing this new category of novelty for us where it's not just going to be how many Batman and Superman shirts we sell this year. We still see a growing and good business there, but introducing this idea that the consumer wants a new story from us and a way to introduce these technical products in new ways that's beyond just the fit, fabric and function, but it's doing it in a fun way. And so I think it's important that the brands have fun, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do that. As you mentioned as well, Camilo, it's going into things like MagZip. It's the simplest innovations that we have. And you got to go -- there's a great quote that's out there that says, \""Whoever invents the next white t-shirt wins.\"" I felt like that's what was did in 1996. Was it earth shattering? Was it groundbreaking? It was so simple and so subtle. And so we're doing that every place where we can find innovation. Several years ago, we set a challenge for our innovation team, our commercialization team to build a better zipper. And no more the zippers, when you sit down, the bottom pops and you can't find, when you're wearing a big pair of gloves, you can't zip it because the male and female are too small. So we made something called MagZip, which is the first one-arm zipper. And it came from an innovation from someone that we found up living in the Northeast whose father had lost use of an arm and all of a sudden recognized that -- and he lived by himself and so is there a better way to make a zipper. And so we're putting that innovation, and into more than 400,000 jackets. And so a couple of stories you learn there is great. First of all, our consumer wins because you've got a better zipper and nobody has ever thought about innovating that. And that's what Under Armour's doing. There is no level. So we'll be innovating at the high end with things like Armour39 and MapMyFitness and at the simple end [ph] with things like -- with MagZip. And also, the partner, the entrepreneur wins. And we're setting an example for every entrepreneur out there in the world to know if you have a great idea, bring it to Under Armour because we're humble enough to know that we don't have all the great ideas, and we want to encourage that to be this open place, this open source where people are bringing them. And we do a great job as editors of curating for the general population of what should be out there. I'll probably -- if you don't mind, I'll take a minute on the Footwear side as we're running out of time here. But I believe we're innovating. When we innovate, we win. You're seeing that happen with SpeedForm Apollo. As I mentioned, we've got a large media event this afternoon at Grand Central Station where did a takeover. And we're seeing the same thing. We did it with Highlight Cleat, and I think really a breakthrough product for us. It showed us that we could be the #1 item of footwear in the market when it comes to something as close to our backyard as the sport of football. But then we also have products that we're updating and getting better. The Anatomix Spawn, which is something we're the fourth leading vote getter for the NBA All-Star team with Stephen Curry who wore that specific basketball shoe on the court this year. So this isn't some code that we're not capable of cracking, it's just a matter of time. And it's happening, and we see the brand moving in the right direction. Finally [ph], Evo is another great product we have right now. And then, of course, the Cadillac that we're really excited about is the SpeedForm Evo. And you've heard me say before that Under Armour hasn't built its defining product yet. This may very well be our next defining product. And I'm not ready to claim that it is, but it has that type of potential. The first shoe built completely in a clothing factory made with that idea and focused on fit, form and function. And it's something that we've got the kudos from people like Competitor magazine rating it best innovation, to Runner's World having that as its best introduction as well, so -- or as the best debut product that they'll have. So we feel like we're really beginning to balance our brand out, apparel, Footwear, and bringing the pieces together. And we know it's going to take time, but we're very encouraged by what we saw in 2013 and the results that we were able to post, that the brand has ever been in better position. We've never been better positioned with kids, which is something we haven't talked about on the call. But there is a -- it seems like there's a real accelerator behind the brand right now. It's something that gives us tremendous excitement and momentum leading in 2014.\nCamilo R. Lyon: That's great. And then just my follow-up for Brad. Just more on the numbers and on ASP front. With all this innovation, we'll take the MagZip as an example, what kind of price increases would you expect to see on a ColdGear Infrared jacket and just generally on ASPs into next year with all of this innovation coming into the product line?\nBrad Dickerson: Yes, it's tough to say in general. But I think ASPs, we've seen pretty consistently over the last few quarters be a couple of percentage points, kind of mid-single-digits up overall. In general, I think that's, again, being driven a lot by innovation and products like ColdGear Infrared. Obviously, our growth story is unit growth, but ASPs are definitely helping us a little bit, too, again more defined towards the innovation and new products we're putting out there in the marketplace. So as far as ColdGear next -- ColdGear Infrared next year, sure we'll look at the price points as we grow that product line. We're still working on final price points for fall/winter to some degree, but you could definitely see an increase in price points of around 10% or so maybe on the ColdGear Infrared side.\nCamilo R. Lyon: Best of luck. And Kevin, I love the Colo-Colo jerseys.\nKevin A. Plank: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Tracy of Janney Capital.\nEric B. Tracy: Great quarter, great year. Kevin, I guess if I could for you, maybe just tee you up a little bit more on the international front, provide sort of a learning from Charlie and his team, where we sort of stand. I know it's not going to inflect materially here over the next 12 months, but any update on the international front would be great.\nKevin A. Plank: Yes, thanks very much, Eric. First of all, we're learning a lot. I think we had a great quarter but there are still a lot of things that we are just beginning to get going in. And especially when you look at the international front. We're in different stages of growth in really all parts of the world, from the U.S., to Japan, to Europe, to China. But we're incredibly encouraged, I think. We're confident that the brand does translate. And as long as we execute and we do the things that we're supposed to do, we've got a real chance to live and fulfill that mission of being a true global brand where someday, more than half of our revenues will come from outside of our home country. So first of all, from a leadership standpoint, Charlie's doing really well for us and building out his team. And I think as we're as at about the 18-month mark with Charlie being on board, he might have broken the record and he's definitely, a Chairman [ph] flyer for United or anybody else. So he's been running all over the world, I think doing a great job there. And basically, though, we're in a position to do all of this, though, because of the strength of the core business, obviously. We use that statement that what's happening in North America for us, that our North American growth and cash creation are going to be the engines that feed our global ambitions for us as a company. If you look across the globe, though, let's just start with Latin America, which is where Charlie really came from, and we really put an emphasis on in his first chapter here at Under Armour. Under Armour Mexico [ph] was an acquisition that we just transitioned successfully beginning in 2014 and really highlighted by the new specialty store that we opened in Mexico City. And again, it's exceeding all the expectations that we had, but again another learning for us of what could be in the Mexican market for us. Brazil, probably top of mind for everyone, but we have a March launch planned for Brazil. We're really going into the [indiscernible] market in time for World Cup and in time, obviously, for the Olympics in '16. But we have an incredibly professional team there. We're starting a premium distribution with Centauro [ph] in places like [indiscernible]. More than 70 shop-in-shops that we'll have at the time of -- by the middle of 2014. Chile as well, Camilo just mentioned the Colo-Colo launch that we had, probably the largest -- one of the largest soccer teams in Chile and really, I think, puts us on the map as we'll continue to attract and go after big assets, big important assets all over the globe. But Latin America, obviously, where global football is something that we can double down. Europe, if I could, it really feels like a tipping point is close. We're really proud of the team, what they've done and the work that's happened in Europe. We'll be crossing $100 million this year for the first time, which is a massive, massive undertaking. And so, as we sit here 8 years in, we're very proud of that team. And more importantly, we're just as believer in what the opportunity in the future looks like. Tottenham, our EPL club there, also is doing well, sitting in fifth place. Tough loss yesterday, but they'll be back to fight another day. And then finally, rounding out in Asia, our partners in Japan are continuing to do incredibly well. The currency exchange hurt us a little bit there from a -- showing up on a growth standpoint. But the brand is getting stronger and our leadership team there is just terrific. Moving down is -- into China. As I mentioned earlier, 13 total stores in '13, growing to more than 50 stores by the end of '14 as well, primarily utilizing a franchise model for that. And then we also did this big experience store in China, which just goes to say is that when we invest there and we invest in the right things and smart things, that we have a chance to win. And so, not a lot of update on the international front, but we feel really good about our Investor Day targets of moving from 6% to 7% of business to more than 12% by 2016. So we'll continue to hold strong and live up to that.\nEric B. Tracy: Really helpful. And let me just -- a second question here. A bit more structural for -- Kevin, for you, and for Brad, in terms of the top line. It seems like cold weather didn't really have a major catalyst in 4Q. Fill rates are moving meaningfully higher. The strength in the core Apparel in North America, layering in Footwear, DTC is still strong. What am I missing? Or what is the potential kind of roadblock in terms of really inflecting to a higher growth rate over the next 12, 24 months? I'm just trying to reconcile the 35% there versus kind of pulling back. I understand you guys want to be conservative, but is there something that's sort of prohibiting from that growth rate to inflect a little bit more aggressively?\nKevin A. Plank: Yes. Let me -- and I know -- I'm going to let Brad answer this, but I just want to be clear as well, is that no question, a great quarter. I heard years ago was that when the weather gets cold, I think we all get a little bit smarter in our industry. So it definitely had an effect. But I think, to Brad's point, there's a lot more to it. So I'm going to let Brad dig deeper on that.\nBrad Dickerson: Yes, Eric, if you look at the front half versus back half, so we've talked about some of the things working in our favor in the front half, again comping some -- a little bit tougher supply chain challenges last year and feeling better about that this year. We also talked about, obviously, our Footwear business and a lot of that growth coming out of the first half of the year. We feel pretty good about that. Obviously, visibility for the front half of the year for us is very, very strong at this point, obviously. The back half of the year, the visibility gets a little bit more tougher for us, especially in the fourth quarter. Again, we're just coming out of this really strong fourth quarter of 35% growth, and what does that mean to our Q4 forecast for next year in our DTC business and our wholesale business. So teams are working through that right now. So there's -- but we'll get more visibility to orders in the fourth quarter. As we work through the first quarter of this year, that'll also be a great data point for us on the next earnings call. So we should have a better idea of what that back half of the year looks like, specifically in our DTC and the wholesale businesses in the fourth quarter. Also, we talked about International growth expansion. It's weighted towards the back half of the year for a lot of the reasons Kevin talked about and the markets we're entering towards the back half of the year. And the realization is, is that we obviously are planning to execute flawlessly in going into these markets, but we want to be cautious because we are entering some new markets for us. So just give ourselves a little bit of room here in the back half of the year, if there's any execution challenges on launching some markets, which is always a very, very complex process in itself. So that's kind of what you're seeing, good visibility front half, a little less visibility in the back half. We have to work through Q4 orders with our customers during the first quarter. And now DTC teams need to work through just what is the cold weather impact from Q4 this year, how much of that do we want to build into next year's forecast, again what is the overall strength of the fourth quarter this year relate to the fourth quarter of next year. So as I said in my prepared remarks, as we get towards the next earnings call, we should have a lot more visibility into the back half of the year.\nKevin A. Plank: All right, Operator, given the time, we're going to conclude the call. But we really want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to reporting to you our first quarter 2014 results, which tentatively has been scheduled for Thursday, April 24, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Thanks again, and goodbye.\nBrad Dickerson: We have one final [indiscernible], we've got a tradition with this, but this year the prediction will be Broncos 38, Seahawks 28. All right.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChristian Charnaux: Thank you, Matthew. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Before we begin we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our year-end results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014; Kevin Jacobs, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, Christian, and thank you all for joining us today. We are certainly very excited to be back in the public markets and to be hosting our first earnings call, following our IPO in December. We are also very pleased with our performance for last year, highlighted by our system-wide RevPAR growth of 5.2%, and our full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.21 billion, which is a 13% increase year-over-year. I'm sure many of you have heard some version of our story on our various road shows. But for those that have not and at the risk of making this call little longer than normal, I thought I briefly highlight our investment pieces before getting into our 2013 performance and our outlook for 2014. When I joined the company in 2007, at the time of the Blackstone acquisition we were presented with once in a lifetime opportunity to take a nearly 100 year old company that had once been a clear leader in this space but had become complacent and return that company to a leadership position. Many of the pieces were there, including a portfolio of distinct brand, spending all the major customer segments, and strong commercial engines that were delivering good results for owners, but we were an average performer at that on the top-line margins, bottom-line and met unit growth. As an enterprise we certainly were not optimized or aligned strategically. So the first thing we did was to get intense alignment of our organization around a common vision, mission, values, and set up key strategic priorities. Well our work in this regard will never be done we have successfully transformed our business into what is now a lean and unified organization over the performance driven culture. This has enabled the new Hilton Worldwide to outperform our competition, while executing a transformation during one of the worst economic downturns in history. I also believe that our transformation has set us up extremely well to continue to outperform in the future. We are in a business where scale and global diversification matter. And today we're a global business with over 4100 properties and 678,000 rooms in 91 countries and territories. We have 10 distinct brands and scaled commercial engines that drive an industry leading global RevPAR index premium of 15%. Tying it altogether is our award winning Hilton Honors Loyalty Program with 40 million members that today makeup more than 50% of total system-wide occupancy. Our goal is simple. To serve any customer, anywhere in the world through any lodging need they have. By doing so we drive more customer loyalty, higher market share premiums, better returns for our hotel owners, and that in turn drives faster net unit growth, and ultimately premium returns for our shareholders. By intelligently deploying our brands to different regions around the world and optimizing those brands for local markets, we believe we can continue to grow in all regions and under all macroeconomic condition. Our development strategy, which I'll get into in a little bit more detail in a few minutes, is based on our goal to win everywhere. We want to be number one in both pipeline and rooms under construction in every region of the world. Today not only do we have the industry's largest pipeline, but we are also number one in rooms under construction in every major region of the world according to Smith Travel Research. More importantly, our global strategy, growth strategy is built around our capital light management and franchise segment and we've been extremely disciplined with our capital allocation. In this segment, we have added roughly 180,000 net rooms to the system since 2007, which has lead the industry with 37% growth over that time, with an investment of only $47 million. Our pipeline has also been built with the minimus amounts of capital. We believe that if we continue to maintain the strongest brands in the industry, we should not have to allocate significant capital to grow. Our shareholders should also benefit from the embedded upside in our ownership segment which today represents 37% of our adjusted EBITDA. Our diverse portfolio includes iconic assets in some of those best global lodging markets such as New York, London, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Sydney. While we are not activating our real estate segment today in terms of meaningful new unit growth we are extremely active in maximizing what we do own. We believe we can realize on the embedded value in our real estate in three ways. First, we are in the sweet spot of the cycle with group demand driving premium revenue growth in our big group boxes, which combine with our disciplined approach to managing cost, should allow us to continue to drive premium margin growth. This is evidenced in our nearly 300 basis point increase in ownership segment adjusted EBITDA margins in 2013. Second, there are a number of significant value enhancement opportunities embedded in our portfolio. A great example of this is that our Hilton Hawaiian Village property, where we recently entered into a transaction to sell the land and entitlements we obtained over the past few years, which will create significant incremental value from what has been a non-income producing part of the reserve, actually a loading dock. Kevin will give you more detail on the transaction in his remarks and we will continue to keep you updated on additional real estate value enhancement opportunities on future calls. Finally, the third way we could create incremental value from our real estate will be to further our migration to a capital light business model by divesting of some or all of the real estates over time. We are not emotionally tied to our real estate and while we intend to keep the vast majority of these properties in the system, there are ways to accomplish that without owning the hard assets. At the moment, we believe we can benefit from the upside on these assets operationally and from mining value enhancement opportunities, but if divesting of some or all of the real estate will enhance overall shareholder value in the future, we will actively consider those options. Shifting gears in our timeshare business we have taken what has been an extremely successful business historically, with both sales growth and margins outperforming competition and transformed it to a much more capital light business. Today, our timeshare segment derives a significant and growing portion of its earnings from fees. In 2013, 54% of our interval sales were on behalf of the third-parties and 78% of our year-end inventory was capital light. We believe that by expanding a new capital light deal, combined with continuing to develop additional smaller phases of new developments on our own balance sheet, we can continue to grow our timeshare EBITDA at a steady pace with significantly less capital investments than has been spent historically. The last part of our investment thesis is the positive fundamentals in the business, both short-term and long-term. On a macro basis, we believe our business currently stands at the intersection of three powerful global trends. Over the past 20 years growth in global tourism as measured by tourist arrivals has doubled, and is forecasted double again over the next 20 years. Driven by a middle class, it has continued to expand from 1 billion people globally 20 years ago to a projected 5 billion in the next 20. Contrasting net dynamic is the fact that hotel rooms per capita in markets like China and Brazil remains at a small fraction of the level of developed markets like the United States. On a more micro basis, the supply/demand environment of the business remained strong with healthy demand growth outpacing levels of supply growth that are still well below long-term averages. Combined, we believe these trends paid a picture of sustainable growth potential for our business. There will be ups and downs for sure over time but I believe the setup for the next several years and frankly for the long-term growth in our business is as good as I have ever seen. So shifting to our performance. Our system-wide comp RevPAR growth was 5.2% for the full year 2013 on a currency neutral basis that was driven by a 3.3% increase in average rates and a 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy. Our hotels continue to benefit from strong fundamentals in 2013 with transient growth outpacing group, but it was group picking up momentum during the year. Group was particularly strong in our Big Box Hotel with group business at our Big 8 hotels up 10%, helping to drive Big 8 RevPAR growth of 9.2% for the year. Our owned and leased hotels in the U.S. also performed well growing RevPAR 6.8% for the year. On a system-wide basis we continue to grow our RevPAR index premium up nearly a 12 percentage point. Our strong top-line performance combined with our disciplined approach to managing cost was a significant improvement operating margins in 2013. Our U.S. owned and leased hotels grew operating margins over 250 basis points and globally our owned and operated hotels grew operating margins over a 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This operating margin performance in our hotels combined with our overall management and franchise growth of nearly 8%, strong growth in timeshare EBITDA of 18%, and continued corporate cost discipline led to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, and overall adjusted EBITDA margins increased over 300 basis points versus 2012. Turning to development I thought I'd cover some highlights including what we're doing on our brands around the world. For starters, we approved a record 72,000 rooms for development in 2013 including over 37,000 rooms in the U.S. nearly 15,000 rooms in Asia-Pacific and nearly 10,000 rooms in Europe. And end of the year was an industry leading pipeline that includes over 1,100 hotels and 195,000 rooms. Historically, our pipeline was heavily concentrated in the U.S. When we got to the company over 80% of the pipeline was located in the U.S. Today it is six years later 60% of our pipeline is outside the U.S. and we have very good balance among the region. We've had great success in the Asia-Pacific region growing our pipeline over 55,000 rooms and our Middle East Africa pipeline is the largest in the industry with over 20,000 rooms. Europe is another great example of the success of our development strategy. In 2007 we knew the European market was likely to be value driven for years to come. By investing in our local commercial capabilities and leading with our conversion of family DoubleTree by Hilton brand and our value oriented Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn brands that we customized for the European markets. We went from three non-Hilton Conrad branded hotels in 2007 to over 200 either open or in the pipeline at the end of 2013. Today, we have nearly 30,000 rooms in our European pipeline and more than 16,000 rooms under construction, which is over as twice as many as our nearest competitor. Pipelines are great but the first step in the process of converting a pipeline into fee paying rooms is getting shovels in the ground. Over half the rooms in our pipeline well over a 100,000 rooms are under construction, which is more than 21,000 rooms or 25% ahead of our closest competitor. Our share of rooms under construction globally of 18.6% outpaces our global share of room supply by over four times. And like our pipeline the geographic breakup of our rooms under construction has shifted dramatically. Today 77,000 or 76% of our rooms under construction are outside U.S. compared to just 13% in 2007, which has increased our rooms under construction outside the U.S. by 14 times during that period. This shift in focus to a more geographically diverse development strategy has enabled us to grow significantly outside the U.S. We now have more than 50% more trading rooms outside the U.S. than we did in 2007. But to be clear we have not lost our focus on growth in the U.S. Our category leading focus service brands are in high demand from the development community and in an environment where most new hotel development is being done in those segments. In our conversion friendly whole service brand led by DoubleTree by Hilton, have enabled us to win more than our fair share of those deals as well. Our approximately 25,000 rooms under construction in the U.S. as of year-end 2013, represents 24% of the total rooms under construction U.S. compared to our 11% share of existing U.S. supply. We believe we're in a sweet spot for branded hotel development in the U.S. With fundamentals creating an appetite for hotel development and capital markets that are strong enough to support development, but with enough discipline remaining in the market to ensure that only quality projects with a strong experience of task to them are getting done. This dynamics is keeping overall supply growth in U.S well below long-term averages but allowing us to grow at a faster pace than our competitors. The next step in converting a pipeline to fee paying rooms is of course actually opening hotels. In 2013, we opened 207 hotels with nearly 34,000 rooms. Conversions accounted for 35% of these openings largely in our DoubleTree by Hilton brand. After removals we had net unit growth of more than 25,000 rooms representing growth of over 4% for the year. It's important to note that we achieved this growth with the minimus amount of capital on investment and without any acquisitions. Given our strong pipeline and our rooms currently under construction, we expect net unit growth to accelerate in 2014 and 2015 which I'll get into a little bit more detail in a couple of minutes. We currently mentioned our DoubleTree brand a couple of times in the context of our growth strategy. DoubleTree is one of the great brand success stories during the time we've been at the company. It has become, I'd say somewhat quietly, the fastest growing upscale brand in the lodging business, having doubled in size since 2007, even while we removed nearly 10% of the brand to improve overall quality. Roughly 75% of the room additions have come from conversions of non-Hilton Worldwide brands. We accomplished this by updating the brand DNA to make it more relevant to our customers and by better connecting the brand to our commercial engines including honors. This better connectivity combined with the improvement in the quality of the brand's hotels and a refreshed brand identity including by Hilton in the name have created significant improvement in customer satisfaction and helped increase the overall RevPAR index of the brand by over 600 basis points since 2007. This of course has led to increased owner profitability and presence for the brand, which has enabled it to drive a significant portion of our growth in North America and in Europe, where value conversion plays have been at a premium as well as accelerating its growth in emerging markets through new build. Last year, we opened our 4000th hotel on the Hubei province of China. China continues to be a strong performing market for us with 6.7% comp currency neutral RevPAR growth in 2013. We now have 43 hotels operating in Greater China that's up from 6 in 2007 and a pipeline of more than 140 hotels with more than 46,000 rooms, the largest in the industry among the global brand. Overall in Asia-Pacific, we've had a great success in growing our business having doubled the number of hotels in the region since 2007. And our pipeline of over 55,000 rooms in the region more than five times larger than it was in 2007. One of these pipeline hotels is the stunning Waldorf Astoria in Beijing, which opened last week. We continue to build tremendous momentum with the fastest growing luxury brands in the business. Our luxury portfolio of Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels has more than doubled since 2007 to 47 properties, the 29 hotels in our pipeline will increase our luxury footprint by more than 40% and in some of the most desirable luxury markets in the world such as Jakarta, Bali, Hainan Island, Grand Cayman, Mumbai, Mecca, Suzhou, Doha, Bangkok, Jerusalem, Amsterdam and many more. Turning to our flagship, Hilton Hotels \u0026 Resorts brand we have also had great success by focusing on simplifying the full service operating model particularly in the developed world. The goals to get customers more of what they want and they're willing to pay for and less of what they don't making the brand more relevant to get and more profitable for owners. Hilton is the number one ranked hotel brand and global awareness and now has 554 hotels opened and the largest development pipeline in its 94-year history with a 150 projects in the pipeline, 95% of which are outside the U.S. In our focused-service category, are more than 2,800 properties remain a formidable engine of growth, both domestically and increasingly internationally. For example, Hampton continues to expand with more than 350 hotels in its pipeline, including more than 160 open or in the pipeline outside the United States. The brand will open its 2000th hotel early in the second quarter and maintains an unmatched market share premium among midscale brands. Home2 Suites by Hilton is another great example of our ability to innovate on the product side to better serve customers needs and enhance our growth rate. Home2 has opened 28 hotels since launching three years ago, with nearly a 100 hotels in the pipeline and its tremendous initial growth has been achieved entirely 100% with third-party capital. Hilton Garden Inn has 581 existing hotels with 214 in its pipeline; more than 50% of the pipeline is located outside the United States. In fact, we recently opened our first Hilton Garden Inn in China introducing our fifth brand to the Chinese market. The response has been very positive and the brand has another 16 hotels in the pipeline in China. Adding Hilton Garden Inn and soon Embassy Suites in China is the result of our belief of having a full portfolio brand with hotels for every type of guest travel need will be as crucial in China as it is in the developed markets. We firmly believe that our brand lineup is the significant strategic advantage and diverse enough to meet most customer needs in most regions but we are always looking to enhance our ability to serve customers globally. As you've heard from my comments, we continue to expand existing brands geographically and we will continue to explore new brand or brand extension opportunities to serve even more customers and owners in the future, which we look forward to discussing with you in future quarters. Another aspect of staying ahead in our business and growing our industry leading market share premium is continuing to innovate. That innovation can come in the form of innovation in our brand portfolio as I described but it also needs to come from the ways we interact with our customers. Today's traveler wants an increasing level of both choice and control and we're taking advantage of our scale to design and implement solutions across our portfolio to given just that. We pioneered and launched e-check-in over five years ago and today our gold and diamond honors members can check-in online or on their mobile devices and also choose their preferred room at over 3,000 hotels. In the not too distant future, we expect to announce significant enhancements and expansion of this service to make all our guests' journey even easier through their digital device. We all know that travels are increasingly mobile and the growth of our mobile bookings continues to explode. Mobile has experienced a more than eight fold increase in revenue since 2010 and has doubled just over the last 12 months. With mobile-enabled booking channels, particularly our enhanced HHonors and Hilton Apps that we launched last year and new apps hitting the market soon mobile certainly a key focus of our digital agenda. We also continue to focus on driving conversion across all our direct digital channels. Millward Brown Digital for example reports almost having the industry leading conversion and booking share in U.S. Our goal is making our direct channels the preferred channel for our guests. In 2013, we invested in expanding our digital languages and launched 22 language booking and in covering 79 countries. Shifting gears back to performance. Let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2014. We anticipate system-wide RevPAR growth increase 5% to 7% for the full year obviously showing positive momentum versus 2013. We have a very positive outlook for group business with both rooms on the books and rates up meaningfully versus last year. Our 2014 group revenue position at our Big 8 hotels is up 10%, compared to the same time last year. And group business for the same period for our larger group of managed hotels in the U.S. is up 7%. As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see generally improving conditions and continued optimism for 2014. In U.S. we expect modestly better GDP growth, which should drive modestly better demand growth, and we expect continued momentum in group bookings, especially with much of the government shutdown and debt ceiling noise behind us. We believe that this demand will be paired with needed supply growth leading to a modestly better RevPAR growth picture than last year. In the Asia-Pacific region, we expect to see continued strong performance again in 2014. Japan was particularly strong as all our hotels delivered double-digit RevPAR growth in 2013. And so far, the outlook for '14 remains very strong as the Japanese government continues to inject liquidity into their markets. China GDP growth is expected to moderate a bit and we expect to see slightly lower RevPAR growth in 2014 of 5.5% to 6%, down from nearly 7% in 2013. In Europe, we expect the improving economic climate experienced in 2013 to continue into '14 and we expect our RevPAR performance to continue to improve a bit as well. London, where we have a very large presence in particular continues to pickup. In 2014 group revenue position in the region overall is up significantly a 20%. Overall, Europe RevPAR growth was relatively strong in 2013 with RevPAR growth of 3.9%, as expected to be up in the mid-single-digits in 2014. The Middle East and Africa region is a tail of individual markets. Our Africa and Indian Ocean, Arabia, Arabian Peninsula, and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia markets have been and are expected to continue to be strong and of course, Egypt remains highly volatile. For the full year 2014, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.365 billion to $2.435 billion. In terms of unit growth, we expect to have 35,000 units to 40,000 units to our managed and franchised segments, on a net basis which would represent 5.5% to 6.5% unit growth in that segment and does not assume any growth from acquisitions. On an overall basis, we are optimistic that 2014 will be stronger than '13. There will undoubtedly be ebbs and flows within regions, but generally the macro trend seem to be similar or better than what we saw in 2013. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs for a little bit more detail on the fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our 2014 expectations.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris suggested, we are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and full year, which exceeded our expectations. We were also thrilled with what we were able to accomplish last year in the capital markets, completing both our debt refinancing and of course our IPO. I will speak in more detail for the refinancing and IPO in a little bit and then we'll get into our 2014 outlook a bit more. But first let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.53 for the full year 2013, compared to $0.45 in the prior year, an increase of 18%. Prior to adjustments net income was $415 million for the full year 2013, compared to $352 million for 2012 or $0.45 per share and $0.38 per share respectively. For the fourth quarter, adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.11 compared to $0.10 in 2012. Prior to adjustments net income was $26 million, compared to $61 million in 2012 or $0.03 per share and $0.07 per share respectively. Special items that have been adjusted in both our fourth quarter and full year results include a one-time charge of $306 million associated with the conversion of our private company compensation plan for senior management into stock at the IPO, which was paid entirely out of Blackstone's ownership in the company and not dilutive to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of our prior debt of approximately $230 million and the release of a tax valuation allowance of approximately $90 million net, as low as the GAAP tax benefit on all of those special items. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $603 million, an increase of 16% over 2012 results. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase over 2012. System-wide comparable RevPAR increased 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year on a currency neutral basis. Our growth rate for the quarter was a bit lower than we saw in the previous three quarters, which was largely driven by a decrease in government business resulting from the government shutdown. During the quarter our brands continued to gain overall market share and we also ended the year with a strong December recording RevPAR growth of over 6%. In terms of our regional performance, in the United States for the year continued economic recovery drove comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of over 5% and comparable U.S. owned and operated hotels were up over 6%. San Francisco and Hawaii remained strong markets for us with comparable RevPAR in those markets up 13% and 12% respectively. The New York market was a bit softer as difficult year-over-year comparisons and the continued absorption of new supply led to RevPAR growth of the market of just 3.5% for the year on a comparable system-wide basis. Our owned hotels in New York were a bit stronger with RevPAR growth of nearly 4%. In Europe, strong performance in the UK and Ireland, particularly in London, as well as key markets in Continental Europe led to comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth for the full year of 3.9% primarily driven by occupancy. Germany, Amsterdam, and Turkey were also strong performing markets for us in the quarter. In the Middle East and Africa region comparable currency neutral RevPAR grew 6.4% for the year, even with continued political unrest in Egypt, somewhat hurting our overall results for the region. We saw strength in the Arabian Peninsula, even with a drag from Saudi visa restrictions and the African Indian Ocean market was strong despite softness in Nairobi due to the terrorist attack that happened there in the third quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region we continued to outperform with strong demand in Japan and China driving comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth of 7% for the full year. Next I'd like to take you through some highlights of our segment results. Total management and franchise fees were $333 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2012. For full year 2013, total management and franchise fees were $1.27 billion, an increase of roughly 8% over the full year of 2012. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBIDTA for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $254 million was roughly 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strong RevPAR growth of 5.1% in the U.S. and operating margin growth at our U.S. owned and leased hotels of over 180 basis points. For full year 2013, adjusted EBIDTA for the ownership segment increased 17% to $926 million, again driven by strong comparable RevPAR growth in the U.S. of 6.1% and cost discipline at our U.S. owned and leased hotels where operating margins increased over 250 basis points. In the timeshare segment, 2013 adjusted EBIDTA of $297 million was 18% better than the prior year. As Chris mentioned earlier we recently executed a purchase and sale agreement with a Blackstone led partnership with third-party capital investors for the sale of certain land and entitlement rights at our Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort in connection with the planned timeshare development project to be called the Grand Islander. This transaction is great example of the tremendous momentum we have in moving our timeshare business through a capital light model and the attraction we've gained in the institutional investor community around the tracking product capital for development. It's also the first step of many and I'm unlocking the embedded value in our real estate portfolio as we expect to generate about $375 million of overall EBIDTA and roughly $180 million of incremental net present value out of what has been historically a non-income producing part of the resort. We expect to commence sales of the timeshare units of the property in the fourth quarter of 2014, and for construction to be completed in late 2016. We will keep you updated on our progress on this exciting project. Turning to our balance sheet, in addition to the $1.24 billion of net proceeds from the IPO, we closed on the complete refinancing of our prior acquisitions got in multiple markets during the fourth quarter, creating a balance sheet that we believe is a tremendous asset for the company and will provide us with an incredible amount of financial possibility for the future. Prior to the IPO, we refinanced a vast majority of our long-term debt through multiple transactions raising $13.1 billion of new debt along with a $1 billion under our revolver. These proceeds along with available cash were used to repay approximately $13.5 billion of debt outstanding, which was the remaining dollars of the loan originated to acquire the company in 2007. The principal components for the refinancing included a $7.6 billion floating rate, 7-year term loan facility and $1.5 billion of unsecured 5.625% senior notes due 2021, as well as a $3.5 billion 5-year commercial mortgage backed securities loans secured by 23 of our U.S. owned hotels and a $525 million mortgage secured by the Waldorf Astoria in New York. We also entered into interest rates swaps on a total of $1.4 billion of the term debt, which set our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt at 50:50. Additionally we put in place approximately $700 million of financing against our timeshare receivables in the form of a $450 million conduit and $250 million of asset backed securities, all of which are non-recourse for the company. Subsequent to this refinancing we made $1.6 billion of voluntary prepayments on the term loan, including $360 million from available cash and the $1.24 billion of net IPO proceeds. As a result the outstanding dollars of the term loan facility at year-end was $6 billion. Additionally subject to the provisions in the loan agreement the margin on the floating portion of this term loan was stepped down by 25 basis points in accordance with the IPO and is now set at 275 basis points. As of year-end we had net debt of $11.5 billion at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.2%, and a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $860 million, including $266 million of restricted cash and we had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolver. Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with 60% to 70% of that being driven by rate. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.365 billion and $2.435 billion. Management and franchise fees are expected to increase between 10% and 12%. In timeshare we expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $325 million. We expect CapEx spending, excluding timeshare inventory, to total approximately $350 million, including about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. We expect corporate and other segment expense to increase between 3% and 5% including incremental public company cost. We expect diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.57 and $0.61 for the full year. For the first quarter of 2014 we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis. In the U.S. and UK we expect the weather we have experienced so far this year to marginally affect Q1 RevPAR growth. However this should be somewhat offset by the lapping of the beginning of the U.S. government sequester during the first quarter of 2013. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of between $480 million and $500, which include a one-time benefit of approximately $25 million from the reversals and the accrual related to the conversion of our prior cash based long-term incentive compensation plan into a restricted stock plan for our Vice Presidents and below. That benefit will reverse itself by year-end in the form of share based compensation expense. Further detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. Matthew, back to you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan.\nChris Nassetta: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Welcome back. Looking at your 2014 EBITDA guidance and other outlook components how does that translate into free cash flow multiple debt reduction for the year? In other words, it is what other non-cash add-backs or the working capital items are there to drive your free cash beside the simplistic method EBITDA less interest less taxes less CapEx?\nChris Nassetta: I think that gets you pretty close to the right number. I mean I'd say that based on the sort of range of outcomes, it's about $700 million to $900 million, roughly that should be available for debt reduction in the year.\nJoe Greff: And then the upfront cash that you get from monetizing the land and your rights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village how much is that I know Kevin you mentioned what's the net present value of that?\nKevin Jacobs: The land sale component of it is $25.4 million and then the rest of the MPV is in the sales and marketing and operating agreements that we're entering into.\nJoe Greff: Chris, earlier you painted a generally optimistic picture for net unit growth. Can you just talk about the mood in the hotel development community specifically in China right now I guess what markets are there with positive momentum and for what demand, how does China generally feel?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I mean -- I'd say still not withstanding the GDP growth is moderating a little bit and they -- and China is clearly been trying to make sure that they don't end up with a real estate bubble. It's clearly still generally pretty positive. There was a period of time I would say sort of in the first half of last year where China development really slowed down. It picked up pretty materially, it didn't get back to the peak levels but it picked up pretty materially in the second half of last year, and what we see so far in China in the beginning of this year and we said in our Investment Committee Meeting in the last couple of weeks where we review all the deals we're doing. It feels -- it still feels pretty good. It is changing and so my comments about Hilton Garden Inn and my prepared comments and what we're doing with the launch of Embassy which will occur later in the year would put in those -- would put my comments for a reason and that is definitely to signal that there is change of thought I think. There's no question that full service and luxury we still have pretty good momentum in China, but the pace at which this new development is getting done I think in the market generally at the high end of the business as close somewhat and I think it's picking up in the midscale segment of the business. So we've been very, very focused on Garden Inn. We think Embassy has adapted for that market as a great sort of value play in the full service space that's going to play well. We haven't done it yet, but we haven't launched it yet, but we've been working on our Hampton launch in the China market. We've done all sort of the background work and research and development work for how we would adapt that product for the market. So I think you're going to look to see that over the next couple of quarters that we will be doing something and what I would describe is sort of the 3.5 star space in China. So I'm -- listen, long-term I'm very optimistic about the development opportunities in China. In the short to intermediate term I'm pretty damn optimistic as well, I just think that the makeup of it is increasingly going to be more in the midmarket and less at the upper end of the market. We're very focused on, as I said, we think it's really important not just for building our business in China, which is important to serve the billion plus people in China, but China is very rapidly becoming the number one outbound market in the world in the next couple of years will have 100 million outbound travelers and we want to have a very sort of like we do in developed parts of the world Europe and U.S., very broad distribution at all the important price points so that we build mass sort of loyalty to our family brand, both to build our business in China, but as increasingly Chinese travelers leave the market they're going to -- we think they're going to stay with the brands when they're in other parts of the world that they become loyal to in their home market. So we're focused on that and I think the most important way that that's going to happen meaning broad distribution within China is going to happen in the three-and-a-half to four star space not in the five plus star space.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.\nHarry Curtis: Yes, very good. I wanted to just focus on the U.S. for a minute. In the U.S., in 2013 you ended -- your occupancy ended at about 73% and you talked about group business in '14 being pretty strong. You really needed that this level of occupancy, what are your occupancy growth expectations for this year? And then the second part of the question is recently what have you been seeing in, in the quarter for the quarter group demand has that been much of a help or a headwind?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, on the occupancy side listen it's a tail of mortgage and assets. So I think as you look at it 73% might -- we're going to have as Kevin suggested, we would probably have our RevPAR growth, you're going to have somewhere between half a point and a point of occupancy growth. You're certainly getting to the point where you don't need a lot more occupancy broadly in the system and my guess is that 60% to 70% rate growth figure that we get will be even higher next year. So I think we're getting from a cycle point of view to the point where as you're implying in your question, we want to be and we certain -- don't get me wrong, we're certainly focused on rates and we will be increasingly focused on rates, but there will be a little bit more broad sort of system-wide U.S. occupancy gain this year. Well that's basically come on the group side, if you look at on average 73% it's great but if you look at it sort of by individual segments particularly looking at the big group hotels, big commercial hotels they still have occupancy to go, because we are mid cycle in my opinion in terms of where we are broadly that is generally when you see the group business come back that's when you see these big hotels really start to perform as a result of building that, that that be. And I would say from the standpoint of the real big boxes and bigger markets unlike may be sort of the limited service in suburban secondary markets, there is more occupancy there. So you're not going to see a whole lot of occupancy and a lot of markets moving, but you're going to see it disproportionally moving in the bigger market and in these big very large hotels, if that answer the question. In terms of I would say that group position I gave you in my comments very strong up year-over-year, the way I would describe pace, which means a different timeframe sort of what we are doing in different periods of time booking on a year-over-year basis. You probably wouldn't be surprised that in the fourth quarter we saw some pace declines and that was we can pretty much track if that was the result of a lot of what was going on with the U.S. Government and the government shutdown and the potential throughout of debt ceiling issues and budget debate that had not been solved, and every time that flares up, we've pretty consistently seen people that are making longer lead decisions and that's what's going on with group, start to freeze up. So we had very healthy pace. I would say in the first quarter through third quarter overall, fourth quarter, not as much we think a direct sort of results for that. And the good news is in terms of what we see thus far this year, we've seen that stabilize and start to pickup. So pace is positive and what we see right now and obviously the position is positive. Now, that we are pretty -- we think certain I mean if not entirely certain that you're not going to have any -- if the budget discussion is done, looks like that everybody has agreed to a increase in the debt ceiling that gets us to the second quarter of next year. At this point, we think that portends very good things for the group business. We think that the business is there, the demand there and without -- this is technical term without the Psychobabble that has been going on in Washington, we think there is a -- that the business will continue to pickup. We obviously saw a great -- I said we were up 10% group in our Big 8 last year; we were up 10% again this year in terms of position. The Big 8 had great RevPAR growth last year. We expect to have a very good RevPAR growth, higher than the high-end of our guidance driven by these factors, which is building both occupancy but also rate in the group side and providing that strong foundation for us to continue to squeeze out lower price transient business and only take the best transient business.\nHarry Curtis: And then, just a very quick follow-up on your incentive management fees. There seems to be some headwinds in 2013, the IMS were pretty flat. What are your expectations for '14; it should be a tailwind in '14?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I think listen what's going on in '13 is just some year-over-year comp issues at the -- we had some contracts that were sort of changed and one in particular, a very big one in Mecca that distorted what was going on with incentive management fees. It obviously -- it's a very positive thing for the company. We restructured an existing agreement and changed the incentive management fee arrangements and returned for I think 4500 new rooms that were doing with this developer in Mecca over the next -- that will be opening over the next three or four years, so a very positive thing, but it distorted the IMS. This year, IMS growth was going to be sort of in the 8% to 10% range. I'd say that's sort of the beginning of a very nice trajectory in the sense that if we look at what we have under construction around the world a 102,000 room, 75%, 80% of those are international the vast majority of those are sort of in the full service and luxury space, almost every one of those have incentive management fee contracts. For the record they don't stand behind on our priorities, those are the really good kind. And as we deliver those hotels into the system -- and obviously they are under construction, so that will be happening fairly rapidly, you will start to see a very nice trajectory of growth and incentive management fee. So the 8% to 10% that you see this year should be over the next couple years ramping up the 20% plus growth in IMS.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Just a quick follow-up on Kevin's comments earlier. When you talk about the Hilton Hawaiian Village deal, when you think about the broader portfolio, how many more opportunities do you guys think there are that are similar in scope and similar in nature to this?\nChris Nassetta: I'd say listen, we're working on it every day and we -- as you can tell from the Hawaiian Village description it's not like we woke up yesterday and said hey here is an idea, I mean it took us probably three-and-a-half years to get the entitlement, to be able to turn that loading dock into a 400 plus unit tower in on Waikiki Beach. And so we've been working on some of these. I'd say we clearly have a handful of these types of opportunities that are sizeable, I don't want to say it's this -- but that are meaningful sort of NPV value to the company. I mean the truth is we have a big real estate portfolio. So we have dozens and dozens of opportunities in that portfolio to create value in every way from an operating point of view and smaller value enhancement opportunities. But the big one, there is probably a handful. There is a Hawaiian Village there; a number of things in New York and our biggest assets is the New York Hilton at the Waldorf Astoria, other assets in Hawaii, like Waikoloa potentially in London with the Park Lane and some others. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Those know me from my prior days as a Public Committee CEO. We would rather do it and then market it rather than market it and then do it. So we are very pleased to be able to announce the Hawaiian Village deal because it's done. We have got great progress on all of the others that I just mentioned. And I think you should expect to continue to see some good progress from us on all of those.\nCarlo Santarelli: And then, if I could just one follow-up. I know you guys mentioned earlier index, RevPAR index, in terms of kind of share in the U.S. not so much from a development standpoint, more so from an operational standpoint, where do you guys see yourself taking it from not may be a specific competitor but within the segments, where do you guys see yourselves most kind of outpacing?\nChris Nassetta: That's always the question that we get and the truth in the matter is we don't ever really know because we know what's happening, otherwise which travel works, right. We know what's happening with us, we don't really know exactly what's happening with anybody else the way the system works. My sense is, and this is going to sound sort of like the obvious answer, it's a little bit of everywhere. I do think that for all the reasons I talked about, when I talked about innovation and I talked about honors and what we're doing in distribution and then what we're doing on online and mobile and e-checking and all these things, I think they suggest that the bigger, more powerful global brand are getting stronger. I'm not saying we're not taking some share from our big global competitors. I hope and my guess is we are a little bit, but I would guess, is sort of, without knowing very specifically, I would guess that more of the share is coming from the independent and the smaller regional and local players. So a little bit everywhere but may be a little bit more from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSteven Kent: So two questions, first, just on debt any guidance on using free cash flow for may be an accelerated debt paydown in 2014 and linked to that your asset sales, your willingness to sell hotels any additional color on the target, the number of hotels you'd like to sell in 2014. How many are actually actively being marketed? And then, so I think to Carlo's question just a moment ago on timeshare inventory how do you balance selling your own versus selling somebody else's inventory? Obviously selling somebody else's inventory is almost like infinite return on investment or pretty close to it. On the other hand leaving assets on your balance sheet, it leaves your own assets on your balance sheet. So I'm trying to get a sense for how you're balancing that over the next couple of years?\nChris Nassetta: I'll take the second and third and may be ask Kevin to then talk about the debt side of it. So on sales we have -- we do not have a lot that we intend to sell in 2014. We do have a few what I'd describe as dribs and drabs, very small assets, a few in the UK that we've been working on. But would be I'd view it as given our scale the minimus. And the reason for that is I said it in my prepared comments that the short version of it is listen we think we're in a sweet spot of the ownership cycle. We like what's going on in those assets. We love what's going through that that portfolio is really very heavily influenced by the group business which is coming back. We just invested huge amounts in over $2 billion over a period of time and in the assets we're getting the benefit of that. We got these value enhancement opportunities that we want to mind and we haven't been able to mind, not because we didn't know how to do it but because our debt structure really didn’t allow us. So our attitude right now is other than as I say some very minor sales, which would be immaterial to really try and mind the value of this. Over time as I said if we believe that there's an opportunity to create incremental shareholder value by doing something with some or all the real estate, we will not be shy about that. The likely way that we would do it would be really more in a sort of structured format, wouldn’t have to be all of it, but it might be in very large chunks of it to make sure that we create tax efficiency. So it's not, as I said we're not in any way emotionally attached to the real estate. Our predecessors may be were, we're not. We're emotionally attached to driving shareholder value rate now. We think the right way to do that is to mind these opportunities and at least the short-term and look at where the market goes and where multiples are and look at whether at some point we think that there is an ARB opportunity where doing something with the real estate would create a greater value preposition for everybody involved. On the timeshare inventory, listen I think the way to think about that is we're very thoughtful about where we're doing these deal and I think what I would say, it's really driven by the customer, right. So we're trying to do deals in markets with third-parties that are not overlapping with our inventory. So it is really driven and we are actively selling both our own inventory and what's remaining as well as third-party inventory. We have little or no overlap. It's really is where we end seeing the demand coming from a customer point of view, increasingly as you know, I gave the stat at the end of the year we were 78% in terms of inventory for third-parties. If you fast forward and you put the numbers in for the Hawaiian Village deal we're going to do, you're sort of in the low to mid 80s. So as time goes on, the fact of the matter is the vast majority of our inventory is from, is representing third-party. But we're actively selling everything that is on our balance sheet and it gets ultimately sort of driven by customer demand.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Steve for the debt question, Chris mentioned $700 million to $900 million of cash available or free cash flow. We would use the entirety of that to repay the term loan. The term loan is floating rate. It's fully pre-payable with no questions. So it's our most efficient debt to repay. And our goal would be to continue use the LION share of our free cash flow to repay debt, but with goals of being investment grade and we think we can achieve that over the next two to three years. We finished the year at 5.2 times net debt to EBITDA. We think we will finish -- if we do that $700 million to $900 million we will finish 2014 in about 4.50 times.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning it's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you?\nChris Nassetta: Hey, Anthony, how are you doing?\nKevin Jacobs: How are you doing?\nAnthony Powell: Doing well. On supply growth there seems to be some supply growth in the focus service segment in the U.S. Do you see hitting the supply impacting some same store RevPAR trends at your focus service hotels in your portfolio?\nChris Nassetta: Not really. I mean, the truth is that that's where all the supply is. I kind of commented on that likely in my introductory remarks. There is very little full service getting done other than few municipal deals that are getting done around the country and almost zero luxury. So it really is all pretty much limited service. Some of that is urban and a few markets like the New York, DC, and other places, most of that is in suburban, secondary, and territory location. What I would say is, I mean clearly, there is a little bit more supply coming. If last year, really get the aggregate data, it was sort of a little below 1%. We think this year it is going to be over 1%. Next year, probably if you look at all of the lead numbers, what's in the pipeline that will get under construction, it's still probably in our mind 1.5%, that's again a 30-year average of 2.5%. So at least over the next sort of two to three years we think it's very muted. We think really in terms of what we see going on, there is quite a bit of discipline in the market. There is money to develop but there's not a lot and it's only with the best developers that it's really getting done and the best brands. Thankfully for us, I think we're viewed given the market share premiums we have as being amongst the best if not the best in that category. So as I said, we got 25% of what is under construction, and we only have 10% or 11% of the existing supply. So we feel pretty good. I don't think -- we don't that there is material impact from it until you get much higher in the supply cycle. So I pick a number, I mean historically, I think you got to get up to 2% or getting up closer to the 30-year average, I think it's probably is the time we have to start to think about it. But we were closer to one then we are two or even one-and-a-half, I think we feel very good about it. And the fact is, demand should be growing and at a little bit faster pace in the U.S. because I think everybody would say -- and now with the government noise behind us at least for this year probably at least a couple of years, that you're going have better GDP growth which is going to drive greater demand growth in an environment where there is still tiny tidy pickup in supply when you look at the aggregate numbers.\nAnthony Powell: And one follow-up. Do you see any opportunities to add new brands to your portfolio? Thank you.\nChris Nassetta: The answer is yes, I did a very crazy job of alluding to that and I apologize for that. As I said, my sort of style those of you know me know what is like -- we want to do things and then market them for you guys and everybody else. So we do have a bunch of ideas. Right now, we're dealing as we talked about with Garden Inn with Embassy in China and a lot of our brands, the existing brands. We are being very strategic about how we deploy those and how we enter various markets and launch those in various regions of the world. We do have some things that we are working on in terms of both new brands and potentially what I would describe as brand extensions of an existing brand. And I do expect sort of over the next two or three or four quarters that you're going to hear at least a couple of things from us in that regard. One, which I know everybody, loves to talk about in the boutique space, which I did ask probably more than any other question on earth and even though you didn't ask it, I will certainly answer it. We are definitely working on a concept there. We have a little different view, which I will wait to explain may be on -- in the next -- a call or two out, but we have had and continue to have a little bit of reviews and our competitors or many of our competitors about how to do that and sort of what exact -- what it looks like, what price point it ends up at. We've done a ton of work, we are getting closer I would hope in the not too distant future we can -- you'll be hearing from us on that. That would probably be the first thing or amongst the first things that you would hear.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Joshua Attie with Citi. Your line is open.\nJoshua Attie: As we think about the 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance, what are the variables that put you at the high and low end? Is it the performance of group business, is it your ability to drive rate or are there markets that are question marks? And I know there are probably multiple items that influence your thinking, but where do you think the main levers are to the upside or downside or the biggest question marks in your mind as you think about this year?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Listen, I think getting to the higher end would depend on the things you alluded to, that the continued strength that we've seen in transient, which has been strong. But we assume if you want to get to the higher end of that then you would have to have at or maybe even a little bit above sort of where the transient growth was. You need the group to show up, the group business to show up the way that the way that we're hoping and we think there is potential for that. And probably I'd say you need nothing big to go wrong in the world. Right, I mean the problem whether there is upside and downside of being a very big globally diversified company that ultimately when Egypt is a problem more if when Japan is strong it's great, if Japan is weak they can drag you down. So I think -- I don't listen, I don't think it's -- I believe that we're pretty upset, we gave a range for a reason because it's a big company, a lot of things can happen around the world. We think that at the upper end of that range, it's possible or we wouldn't give you that range and I think it depends on those things. Continued slight uptick in transient, definite uptick in group, and so a nothing major going wrong around the world.\nJoshua Attie: And I know you don't want to give too many details on projects until they're finalized, but can you talk broadly about your thoughts on the Waldorf in terms of a potential redevelopment?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, we have spent a lot of time and some money as you can see if any of you have been to the Waldorf, we've spent over the last five or six years about $175 million and some of that's sort of behind the wall, so you don't see it. Some of it is upfront, I mean, we've been working on the exterior of the building to do the work that needed to be done for about a 100 years. We did -- we have redone the Park Avenue lobby, the motor court. If you haven't seen I mean, amazing progress and done a lot of work to figure out sort of from a rooms point of view what we want to do. We have not taken that next step, because we've been in the process of doing -- excuse me a whole bunch of work and analysis around what's the highest and best use would be from a -- from standpoint of maximizing the value to the shareholders of the company and there are a bunch of different ways to do that and there a bunch of different people, we could do that with recognizing that not to coy that we talk a lot about capital light, obviously it's really complete what we like to have at the Waldorf, certainly it would require a lot of capital. So I would say to you by the end of this year hopefully sooner, we will be in a position to layout exactly what we think the plan is to the Waldorf both in terms of what we're going to do with it physically and who we might do it with in order to continue to focus on our being capital light. And I'm sorry to be coy, again we're just in the middle, we've done a kind of work over a bunch of years, we're sort of in the middle of completing that work and I don't think it's going to be too far out before we can give you good sidelines. We will fix the Waldorf that I will tell you and there a couple of different sort of major pathways to doing that and we're finishing the work to be able to conclude that.\nOperator: This concludes today's Q\u0026A session. I will turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Well, thanks everybody. Listen, I said a couple of times, it's great to be back, it took us six year hiatus from the public market, but after 50, I think consecutive earnings calls it's nice to be back doing quarterly earnings calls. We are obviously very pleased with our results for 2013, both the fourth quarter full year. We feel great about the environment, very optimistic about 2014, and we will look forward to giving you an update after we complete our first quarter. Thanks again for spending the time with us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 2, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan José Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJuan José Orellana: Thank you, Colin. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. Additionally, we announced certain management changes today that we will also be discussing. On the call with me today are Dale Wolf, Chairman of our Board of Directors; Joseph White, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you've multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Dale Wolf.\nDale B. Wolf: Thank you, Juan José. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll start by providing some context around the board's decision to make the leadership changes that we announced earlier today, and then I'll turn the call over to Joe White to discuss our results for the quarter. In light of the company's disappointing financial performance and after careful consideration and analysis, the board determined that a change in leadership was necessary in order to drive profitability through operational improvements and other initiatives. The board believes that now is the right time to bring in new leadership to capitalize on Molina's incredibly strong franchise and the opportunities we see for sustained growth going forward. To be clear, these changes represent targeted and deliberate actions to enhance the company's focus and improve our competitive position within the industry. We're pleased to have someone with Joe's experience, institutional and industry knowledge capable of serving as our Interim President and CEO at this time. Joe has over 25 years of financial management experience in the healthcare industry, and served as Molina's Chief Accounting Officer since 2003. He has led the company's most recent operational improvement initiatives and is a widely respected leader both within the company and in the greater healthcare industry. Separately, I'm honored to have the opportunity to serve as Molina's Chairman and lend my experience to help guide the company forward. The board remains sharply focused on ensuring an orderly leadership transition and is commencing a search process for Molina's permanent CEO. In the meantime, we're grateful to have Joe at the helm. I would be remiss if I did not say the board appreciates Dr. Mario and John Molina's leadership and contributions for more than two decades, and looks forward to their continuing insights as directors. I want to assure you Molina's business remains strong. The company has an outstanding brand and franchise built over three decades, based on a focused commitment to mission. The board is committed to continuing this mission, achieving operational excellence and improving the company's financial performance on behalf of our shareholders, our more than 20,000 employees and our over 4 million members. We believe we can capitalize on Molina's strengths to build significant shareholder value. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe to review the quarter.\nJoseph W. White: Thank you, Dale, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Today, we reported net income per diluted share of $1.37 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $1.47 for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income per diluted share of $0.43 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.51 for the same period last year. First quarter results includes a $75 million pre-tax benefit from the receipt of our Aetna-Humana break-up fee. This break-up fee added $0.84 per share to both net income per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share for the quarter. Today's results which are consistent with our expectations represent a notable step forward for the company. Now, I want to speak to some of the line item details in the financial statement. Premium revenue increased over 15% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, while membership increased nearly 13% during the same period. We added more than 500,000 new members in the first quarter, most of whom are rolled into Marketplace. While we are still early in the year, we think that, as of today, both the operational and the financial performance of our Marketplace product is better than what we saw in 2016. Of course, just has been the case in previous years, we can expect our Marketplace enrollment to decline during the remainder of the year. Our medical care ratio in the first quarter of this year was 88.4% compared to 89.8% in the first quarter of 2016. This 140 basis point decline in the medical care ratio was a result of higher percentage margins in our Marketplace and Medicare products. Our consolidated medical margin measured in total dollars increased by more than 30% to $537 million this quarter when compared to the same period last year. Our general and administrative expense ratio increased to 8.9% for the quarter, a 110 basis point increase from the prior year. But as we outlined during our Investor Day presentation back in February, these results are in line with our expectations for the full year. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance. As we've said on past calls, we adjust guidance only when we believe that there is a material change to the business from what we have previously communicated. As we announced in today's press release, we have confirmed our previously issued guidance for full-year earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share, while also updating that guidance to reflect the break-up fee associated with the Aetna and Humana acquisitions as these were not included in our original outlook. It is important for me to reiterate that this change only adds the termination fee into our existing outlook and that we have not made any additional adjustments beyond that. Also, please note that our outlook does not include an estimate for severance charges associated with today's announcement. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to consider our options for marketplace participation in 2018. I think everyone is well aware of the variables in play here, funding of the cost sharing rebates for both 2017 and 2018, continuation and enforcement of the individual mandate and risks of adverse selection all create uncertainty around the future of the marketplace. We are currently evaluating all our options for marketplace participation in 2018. We expect to decide upon 2018 pricing, geographies and product offerings in the coming weeks. Finally, as of March 31, 2017, days and claims payable decreased sequentially by two days to 45 days and the company had unrestricted cash and investments of nearly $5.3 billion, including approximately $270 million at the parent company. While medical claims and benefits payable were flat between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, amounts due government agencies increased by almost $375 million or slightly over 30%. This concludes our prepared remarks. Colin, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nZiv Israel: Hi, this is Ziv Israel on behalf of Kevin Fischbeck. Can you comment on the timing of the management change, just seems a little unusual to provide guidance in February, then have the Analyst Day, and then change management or reaffirming the outlook three months later. Was there any concern about the ability to achieve this year's guidance or a general concern about the ability to grow from 2018 and beyond?\nDale B. Wolf: Hi, this is Dale Wolf. I think you're reading too much into any of those. They're unconnected. As Joe mentioned, we have affirmed guidance for the year. So it has nothing to do with that. It was merely a continuation of a process, of the board's evaluation of the road forward, and our sense that we were not keeping up with our competitors in terms of creating value for our shareholders. And that process obviously takes some time to work through and commentated in today's announcement. No more, no less.\nZiv Israel: Okay. So when you think about what Molina has to do from here, where are the biggest areas of change that need to happen under the new management? What do you think they should focus on or execute on?\nDale B. Wolf: I think it's premature to list out specifically. There's a lot of work to do both by new management and – with the oversight of the board in terms of what those areas of opportunity are, we have some thoughts based on experience, but they're merely that. And we will – this will fact-based and we will work with management of the company to identify those opportunities and communicate them when we can.\nZiv Israel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks. Good evening. So I understand, Dale, your comments around not keeping up with shareholder value and I think you can document that. I'm just curious in light of what appears to be a relatively quick decision, or at least one that was not inclusive of management in terms of that process, what sort of diligence did the board do around the impact on the business? I'm thinking about did you talk to some of the major states or stakeholders in the company? Did you guys look at RFPs that are coming up including rebids? Have you thought about a rebranding that maybe necessary? What's the total cost? Is there a potential impact to goodwill? All that sort of stuff, I'm just curious, I understand the perceived benefits, but I'm just curious on how you guys weighed that against the costs?\nDale B. Wolf: You asked a lot of questions in there, Josh. So I like to think that we considered all those factors and we do understand that there are a lot of RFPs coming up. I think those are pretty local market things, but we understand most of the other points you raised and it was just our sense that all things considered maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but this was the necessary and right thing to do for all of the constituencies of the company and not only the shareholders, but all the constituencies of the company.\nJoseph W. White: And Josh, it's Joe. I would just add we are feeling very confident about re-procurement of the various RFPs that are out there.\nJoshua Raskin: And can you share maybe some of the feedback from those various state constituents, were they comfortable with this change coming?\nDale B. Wolf: As you might imagine, Josh, there was no way that it was appropriate for us to go and ask them what they thought about this and so we don't have any feedback, we didn't do that.\nJoshua Raskin: Okay. And then, I guess, just more internally, are there concerns over employee retention, just in light of the founder and family sort of having run the business for almost 40 years, I'm just curious if you've gotten any feedback since this afternoon.\nDale B. Wolf: I think it's a little early to tell on that. Changes like this take a while to fit in with the company. I met with the leadership team of the company today to just assure them of the board's commitment to the future of this company and commitment to the mission, notwithstanding the need for operational and financial improvement. And one of the things we talked about is the communication that would be needed going forward with employees to say those kinds of things to them and make them feel comfortable and a lot of those people joined this company because of its mission or certainly stayed because of its mission. And it would be crazy to do anything different than that and we don't intend to, we just need to communicate that to people in a time like this. You can't over communicate.\nJoshua Raskin: Okay. All right, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello everybody. Maybe just first to ask, because I don't think it's been directly asked at least, so you're going through this process and you're now going to go out and look for a permanent CEO. Are broader strategic options on the table or is it strictly right now we just need to get a new CEO in here?\nDale B. Wolf: The latter. We've got a lot of confidence in the franchise that's here and the potential of unlocking shareholder value and that's what we're set about to do including hiring a new CEO.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe Joe, if I could just ask quickly on two quarterly items, it looks like you reduced the PDR by $22 million from $30 million at the end of the year for the health insurance exchange and you said it performed consistent with expectations. Can you give us a little color on that? It also looks like you realized unfavorable prior period development in Illinois Medicare and Medicaid to the tune of $20 million or $0.22, can you give us some color on that as well?\nJoseph W. White: Sure, sure, A.J. You have your numbers reversed on the Marketplace PDR. We brought in $8 million of the $30 million PDR we booked at 12/31. So we have $22 million left. So there is an $8 million PDR reversal in the quarter.\nA.J. Rice: Okay.\nJoseph W. White: In general, marketplace, as I said in my remarks, seems to be going better than it has in the past both operationally and financially. Unlike first quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2017 we didn't have a lot of unfavorable development of our estimates around risk adjustment, which was very welcome news. We feel like we're getting better setting those accruals. So in general, again, we're one quarter into the year, so I don't want to say too much. But so far, so good as far as marketplace for 2017. The Illinois situation, well, it's just one of those situations occasionally where in a given health plan, you have substantial unfavorable prior period development of claims. These are very complicated claims, often hospital claims that have extended back into 2016 and sometimes 2015. We feel like we gotten that cleaned up and feel like we're in pretty good shape going forward in Illinois, but it is about $20 million of unfavorable out-of-period development in Illinois this quarter for Medicaid, not Medicare.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thanks. Good evening. First question, just wanted to get a sense of – in terms of the longer term margin targets that John and Mario had discussed and committed to in terms of both the 4Q sort of exit trend on long-term margins and then what the company was aspiring to. Are you comfortable in sort of reaffirming those at this point or would that be sort of under review as Joe and then a newer CEO came in and sort of develop the strategic plan?\nJoseph W. White: Excuse me. Well, Scott, to be clear, it's Joe speaking, to be clear, we walked those numbers back a little bit at Investor Day. We don't necessarily think we said in Investor Day in February of this year, we don't think we can exit that in that range, that margin range for 2017. So that's already been on the table. There's no reason, based on our confirming guidance today, we haven't gotten worse, but again, we need to go back and revisit those numbers. And as we said at Investor Day in February, we'll be back to you when we're more confident with something. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. Joe, I had just a quarterly question just on – in California, it looks like the MLR large there year-over-year was pretty low, it came at 79.2%.\nJoseph W. White: Right. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Was that just a function of the mix of the exchange numbers or was there anything sort of unique going on in the first quarter there?\nJoseph W. White: No, it was just a marketplace issue. I mentioned that in total we only came down $8 million in our PDR for marketplace in the quarter, but we rearranged between states, and California actually took about a $25 million PDR benefit in this quarter. If you take marketplace out of California results, it ran in the mid-80s this quarter, which is a good quarter, but nothing extraordinary. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the sort of classic TANF and CHIP business, it looks like the MLR there was up around 260 bps year-over-year and it was sort of over 93%. So I know you cited some of the dynamics around Illinois. Just more holistically, though, just want to get a sense for the trends in that product line. And then was that segment profitable in the first quarter at that MLR? And if not, do you expect that to sort of be profitable for the full-year?\nJoseph W. White: Well, to be clear, we've talked about over the last few years that premium increases for the TANF and CHIP business have been lagging what they need to be, have been lagging medical cost trend, and frankly, have been lagging other products. You're right that that $20 million unfavorable development in Illinois, that's predominantly TANF that has a huge impact on it. I would just say though, at a 93% MLR, I would say that TANF is borderline profitable. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay, all right. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAna A. Gupte: Yeah. Hi, thanks. Good evening. Well, again back to the management transition, I guess the question I had was, when the board was contemplating these changes and you were looking at the root cause of your financial performance in the last whatever time period, did you see it more around you don't have the necessary scale and the diversification to maybe take a blip in a state like Ohio or enter a very challenging new market, like exchanges, or was it more about we're not executing correctly and the organization needs to be turned around or is it a bit of both and how might that play into how things move forward?\nDale B. Wolf: Ana, I haven't seen anything to suggest, and I think that I speak for the board, that we aren't big enough or not diverse enough to perform better than we have. And so until proven otherwise, I'm in the camp of it's just all about execution. Execution and paying attention to the day to day details of medical cost management, administrative expense control, and on, and on, and on. It's a great franchise. It's got great assets, and we just need to improve the results.\nAna A. Gupte: Okay. I guess I'll just give like one example has been – I would say Aetna I think had some issues in the fourth quarter on exchanges and United sustained some unbelievable losses. But when you're making mid to high-single digit pre-tax margins on the rest of your book, and you have 10%, and exchange is losing 10%, it's still okay and you make your numbers, but in Molina you have 1% net margin on 90% of your business and then if you lose 10% on 10% that can be really move the needle, I mean that's where my questions is coming from.\nDale B. Wolf: Exactly. So my response to that is not to get rid of the 10%, you lost 10% on it to make the 1% net margin better, and that's where we're headed.\nAna A. Gupte: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Dale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSarah E. James: Thank you. It seems like the biggest opportunity for margin improvement is on the exchange risk adjuster, specifically the encounter data capture. What is Molina doing to improve capturing risk adjuster data on the new exchange members and is there any improvement over last year on the percent of members that you have data on so far?\nJoseph W. White: Sarah, it's Joe speaking. I think the answer to your second question is yes, we do have more information on our members. There are a couple of things at play here. First of all, we retained, I think, 80% or so of our December 2016 membership coming into 2017. We obviously have huge lag up in understating the healthcare conditions of those members. We've also taken a number of initiatives to improve data capture on risk adjustment and member targeting and member risk assessment. I think to some degree our ability to better estimate our risk scores at the end of last year might be a reflection of having better data on our members. And I think carrying over into this year, we've seen improvement. It's not a tidal wave, it's not a landslide, it's a lot of hard work, crawling through data, looking for clues and learning how to engage members. But I think we're doing well at it. And I think come 2018, where we have the change in methodology and we're allowed to bring on pharmacy data in support of risk scores, we're going to get even better.\nSarah E. James: Thanks, Joe. And maybe if I take the comments that you made about spending more time crawling through the data and comments Dale made about an increased focus on medical management, how does that fit within context of your already planned IT investments for this year and where it might need to go under this new focus?\nDale B. Wolf: My opinion, Sarah, is that really a lot of our initiatives related to medical management, yes, there are technology initiatives, we're finding and implementing ways to reduce the number of screens, for example utilization management and medical management personnel have to click through as they address the members' needs, a lot of it is training too, and a lot of it is leveraging best practices from one health plan to the next and making sure that the knowledge is disseminated throughout the company. So it's not purely an IT solution. I don't think we're going to need massive increases by any stretch of the imagination in our CapEx or anything like that. I think what we're going to do is try to focus harder on learnings from one part of the company and bring them to bear in other parts of the company.\nSarah E. James: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Heinz Costa: Thank you. What percent of your business is up for rebid this year?\nJoseph W. White: I don't have that (26:57), honestly, I got that number here, states that are up for rebid, probably about $700 million or $800 million of revenue, so $700 million or $800 million of revenue on our $18 billion – I'm sorry, 3.5%, sorry, doing this in my head, $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenue on an $18 billion or $19 billion base.\nPeter Heinz Costa: And that includes the Texas STAR+PLUS Program and the Florida Medicaid LTE program?\nDale B. Wolf: Yeah.\nJoseph W. White: Yeah.\nDale B. Wolf: Peter, I'm sorry for my voice. It's really concentrated in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico is coming up in 2018. So that's a little bit beyond a year. But that's – it's really Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico and Texas.\nJuan José Orellana: Yeah, Peter, this is Juan José. There's a slide in the Investor Day deck. You can take a look at all the markets and the estimated timeframes for when those businesses are going to be reprocured.\nJoseph W. White: Right.\nPeter Heinz Costa: Yes, but doesn't have the revenues associated with it (28:10).\nDale B. Wolf: Yeah.\nJuan José Orellana: Right.\nPeter Heinz Costa: And moving on, there's a question regarding the process that you're going to go through for looking for a new CEO, so we kind of track that. What is your timeframe you expect that process to go through and when should we have a result from that? And then Dale, are you a candidate for that because you've run health plans before?\nDale B. Wolf: Let me take the easy one first. No, I'm not. I actually have a full-time job today. I have a company in Florida, a private equity company that I run and that's where I live and that's what I'm going to keep doing. So no is the answer to the second question one. The first process is just getting started. We will be interviewing search firms over the next several weeks. We hope to have a search firm under contract within 30 days and then the process will be the process. I think that those who've been through this before would tell you that it might takes six months, that would be very disappointing to me. I hope to have it wrapped up well before that.\nPeter Heinz Costa: Okay. And then maybe this is a question more for Joe. Joe, you tapped 27% of your PDR in the first quarter here, given that the claims tend to grow in the ACA business through the year, don't you think your – that would imply you've got more risk going into the back part of the year for your guidance to be maintained?\nJoseph W. White: I don't really look at it that way. As the year rolls out, obviously, we've got nine months, we've got nine months of PDR to focus on versus 12 months that we had at the beginning of January and we've gotten better insight into developments this quarter with the benefit of three months of experience. So no, I'm feeling pretty good about our PDR right now.\nPeter Heinz Costa: And did you have any other PDR left – or any charges left from last year that can be applied for the risk adjusters when they come out in June for last year?\nJoseph W. White: I'm sorry, could you ask that question again, Peter, I didn't quite follow.\nPeter Heinz Costa: When we were in the risk adjusters for last year in terms of how that played out, do you have anything left in reserve for that at this point or is that expected to be booked – you booked it already?\nJoseph W. White: I think we're pretty tight on our reserve estimates, I don't think they're overly conservative if that's what you're asking. So no, I don't think there'll be a benefit when we settle up. I think we're pretty much spot on in terms of our estimates of 2016 risk adjustment right now.\nPeter Heinz Costa: Okay. And the last question is just sort of a detail. It looked like the guidance is down by about $0.03, is that correct, or is there something else that I'm not understanding about the overall guidance number relative to where you look for?\nDale B. Wolf: No, what we've essentially done is, we've confirmed guidance. We then added on to that the benefit of the Aetna-Humana break-up fee. And again, we haven't put any potential severance in there, so that's open. But no, I think what might be confusing you is guidance assumes a higher share count than is in our first quarter results. So that creates about a $0.03 difference between the $0.84 we reported in the benefit for the Aetna-Humana transaction this quarter based on first quarter share count, but for guidance share count it would only be $0.81.\nPeter Heinz Costa: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you gentlemen.\nDale B. Wolf: It's all arithmetic.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nThomas Carroll: Hey, guys. Thank you. If I could just follow-up on Peter's question initially Dale about the CEO search, I wonder if you could give us a sense of kind of your thinking about that role going forward at Molina? I mean, thank you for the timing, less than six months sounds great. But is this a person that, maybe came directly from the Medicaid world in the past, is this a person that came out of Medicare or is it maybe a combination of government focused candidates you're going to look at or everything really on the table in terms of options?\nDale B. Wolf: Everything is on the table in terms of options. I think it would be a great benefit to have someone who is pretty damn familiar with the government business, Medicaid for sure and hopefully some Medicare. So you know how you do these things, we're going to look for best athlete, but part of best athlete is having the right sets of experience.\nThomas Carroll: And then is there the beginnings of maybe an operational improvement plan outside of what we've already heard from the company that you could tell us about or is this something that really is going to be formulated by the new leadership?\nDale B. Wolf: I think that somewhere in the middle, it's nothing we're prepared to share today, but while we're searching for a CEO this place isn't going to stand still. And the team here with interim leadership by Joe is going to be focused with the board on what we need to get going. And we're not going to wait for the new person to come, they will certainly be a big player in that, but we'll be working in the coming weeks and months on some of those initiatives directly.\nThomas Carroll: So, it's fair to assume you've got a kind of a punch list of things to do that you're starting on right away as opposed to waiting? That's what it sounds like.\nDale B. Wolf: Punch list makes it sound too flushed out and specific, but thoughts would be a better description.\nThomas Carroll: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good afternoon. I guess I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into the delay in the annual shareholder meeting and the management changes, but was there anything, and clearly you're now appointing the people as executives, Dr. Molina and John, but was there anything as a part of sort of the normal proxy process that sort of raised some additional red flags with regard to the management team. Thanks.\nDale B. Wolf: So the reason for the delay in the shareholder meeting is that it is a requirement that all material information be in the hands of stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate and consider it before they cast their shares. So we therefore deemed it would have been inappropriate to hold the meeting tomorrow with this important news today, and that is entirely the basis of the one-week delay, it is to make sure we complied with that rule.\nChris Rigg: Okay. And then just wanted to circle back up on the letter that the company had sent to congressional leadership last week. One of the things that jumped out to me was the comment that said if the cost sharing reductions or subsidies remained in place that Molina would continue its participation in the health insurance exchanges in 2018, and that seems to run a little contrary to the way management had talked about their participation at the Investor Day. So I guess is that the company's stance right now. So as long as the subsidies are maintained, you guys will continue to fully participate next year regardless of how things ultimately track through the quarter here? Thanks.\nJoseph W. White: Hi, it's Joe speaking. I think a better way to express that would be that funding of the CSR is almost certainly a requirement for our participation in the exchange. It doesn't make it this positive (35:59) that we would indeed participate, but it's difficult, it probably can be done, but it is difficult to price around the absence of a CSR.\nChris Rigg: Right. But I guess – and sorry to push you, Joe, but I guess the way I think a lot of people interpreted what you put in there was the CSRs alone were enough to ensure participation, not your financial performance?\nJoseph W. White: I think that's a little – yeah, I think that's a little bit of a naïve reading of the letter, obviously, there is everything that goes into pricing from the rates to your provider network to competition to everything else. So I wouldn't read it in that light.\nChris Rigg: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael J. Baker: Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to get an updated view on Medicare and how that will fit, because I know recently there was kind of more of a focus in on potentially expanding that more aggressively and just wondering some updated thoughts on that front.\nJoseph W. White: It's Joe speaking, couple of thoughts on that. First of all, in terms of Medicare, as you can see by the results we published today, we're having good progress, good success in terms of managing costs and improving margins in our Medicare products in general. So that's certainly a highlight. It is a long-term, the company does indeed wish to participate further in the Medicare market, that's going to be a deliberate and measured approach. And to how we do that is not going to be broad-brush, but it is company policy and company practice to engage in markets such as Medicare and we will do that again in a measured and deliberate way.\nMichael J. Baker: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Barrett with TCW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Barrett: Hey, thank you for fitting me in. Given the unusual timing of the dismissal, I just want to ask you all to confirm that there was, aside from just performance, there was nothing that we can expect to hear regarding any kind of fraudulent activity or any reason, be it criminal or civil that you decided to make this change in what is certainly perceived as an abrupt way? Thank you.\nDale B. Wolf: The information that we shared in the press release as to what was behind the board's thinking and what we've shared on that call today is exactly what we said it is and it's all we said and it's all there is to say. And so all of the things that you've suggested were never a part of that consideration.\nPatrick Barrett: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question, coming from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nAna A. Gupte: Yes. Hi, thanks. So just a follow-up on the base business on Medicaid, and as you're looking at your plan for margin expansion as you said on your base business, are there any kind of systemic things that you think you can do to improve margins across the board or is this more kind of a local market, state-by-state phenomenon? And finally, as you're talking to governors and if they're concerned at all and I know the vote and all is up in the air, but what might the rate environment look like, and if repeal and replace goes through, might they start crawling backwards in advance of potential cliff in 2020?\nJoseph W. White: Ana, it's Joe speaking. First of all, I think it is a state-by-state effort. There are certainly certain centralized activities in terms of collecting data, collecting encounter information and there are a number of standard activities that go into getting the right rates for our members. But yes, I think it's fair to say that it is a state-by-state basis. As far as future funding in Medicaid, we as a company understand that government spending for Medicaid, whether federal or state, is going to be constrained more in future years and we're trying to build a company that is a low cost provider of care for just that reason.\nAna A. Gupte: Okay. All right. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. Mr. Orellana, I'll now turn the presentation back to you, you may continue with your closing remarks.\nJuan José Orellana: Well, thank you very much everyone for joining us today, and we will be updating you next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kroger’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger’s first quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. As we all know, there is a lot of change in the food retail industry – both in terms of the operating environment and competitive landscape. The best thing that we can do is to stay on the offense by continuing to focus on our customers – what they want and need today and what we anticipate they will want and need tomorrow – and executing our strategy. We continue to manage our business for the long-term and to deliver earnings growth on a three-year to five-year time horizon. We are making meaningful investments in our digital and online growth. We believe that customers of the future will want to shop with us for anything, anytime, and anywhere. In the first quarter, we saw more than 30% growth in new digital customers and a more than 30% increase in digital visits – with faster growth in mobile compared to last year. We are also building on our personalization expertise to benefit our customers. An example of this is My Magazine, which delivers personalized content like recipes to loyal households based on their shopping behavior and interests. In fact, we delivered more than 6 million unique My Magazine offers in the first quarter alone. This also allows us to offer personalized lower prices to our loyal households in addition to the low prices everyone can see. This is another example of how we leverage 84.51’s expertise. We are investing in our people. We are improving customer service by both increasing labor hours in certain areas and increasing starting wages in certain markets. Taken together, these steps will improve the customer experience and improve retention. I share these examples to demonstrate that we are laser-focused on providing our customers with the right value proposition. This is our Customer 1st Promise - our commitment to provide friendly service, fresh foods, and low prices, every day. And this is what we will continue to do, regardless of the external factors, because it’s what our customers deserve and what we know ultimately that delivers shareholder value. These investments both maintain and enhance our position in our markets. And while it is still early in 2017, we are starting to see some traction. We are happy with the better identical sales trend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, and we are pleased to see that our current identical sales trend is positive. The last nine weeks of the first quarter were positive, and so is our second quarter to date. Our teams continue to innovate in new and exciting ways that reflect where our customers are going. Recognizing the demand for convenience, high quality, and best value, Kroger’s Culinary Development Team launched an incredible collection of Prep+Pared meal kits that we are currently piloting in Cincinnati stores. We can hardly keep them on the shelves! And it's easy to see why as soon as you try them. Kroger’s Prep+Pared meal kits offer restaurant-quality meals that are easy to cook in about 20 minutes. We think customers will love knowing they are available in stores when they are wondering along about 2 o'clock in the afternoon what’s for dinner. Our Brands are one of the primary means we have to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Last year, we commissioned an independent third-party to conduct research that would give us an objective view of how our customers view Our Brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private label foods. Our research showed that the most-loved brands sold in our stores are Our Brands above even the national brands! And in the blind taste tests, Our Brands outperformed competitive national brand and other private label products almost 100% of the time. Our products in Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands rated significantly above their respective competitive offerings. Of course, our journey is never done so our customers will continue to see rising quality and better value on Our Brand products in the future. By having brands our customers love that are only available from us, we gain loyalty and advocacy from our customers. Our Brands represented approximately 28% of total units sold, and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy, during the first quarter. Our customers’ needs are constantly changing. What doesn’t change is their desire for a welcoming customer experience with an abundant variety of food, available when and how they want it, all at a great value. That’s why we regularly evolve the execution of our Customer 1st Strategy, while the core strategy itself doesn’t change. Too often, American consumers have to make a choice between low prices and a great experience, compromising one for the other. Kroger is uniquely situated to eliminate the need for that compromise; serving customers who are hungry for more than food, who want to be nourished in ways that help them live their lives best. Kroger’s purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit and we are more confident than ever that by living our purpose and delivering our Customer 1st Promise, we’ll deliver long-term shareholder value that you can count on. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend. And here is Mike to go into more detail on our first quarter results. Mike?\nMichael Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Like Rodney said, we were glad to see the better results compared to the fourth quarter for identical food store sales and for the second quarter-to-date, our ID sales are positive. Tonnage continued to be positive during the first quarter. We continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products as well as areas where we are saving customers’ time, such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meal solutions. Visits per household were flat in the first quarter. Basket size and price per unit were down, but those were offset by household growth. Loyal households grew 3.2% compared to last years first quarter and our loyal households had positive ID sales growth in the first quarter. In the first quarter, our gross margin was down, operating costs were up, and FIFO operating profit was down. While this is not representative of our typical expectations, it is important to keep in mind that we are making very deliberate and targeted investments in line with our Customer 1st Strategy. As Rodney outlined earlier we’ve made conscious decisions to increase starting wages in certain markets to improve associate engagement and retention that will create a better experience for our customers. We continued to invest and grow our digital business. Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year. This includes revenue from ClickList, Harris Teeter’s ExpressLane and Vitacost.com. As we continued to invest in price, we also remind you, Kroger’s investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at our gross margins in the early 2000s compare to today. Kroger has invested more than $3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers over that time period. We have no intention of giving up the momentum we’ve gained on low prices. These investments enable us to connect with our customers in a deeper way and increase our market share over time. We are pleased that Kroger’s market share, as traditionally calculated, was up in the first quarter. That said, we recognize there is no perfect metric for capturing market share. We are doing a lot of work to better define or perhaps redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We see food as a massive, $1.5 trillion market, and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market. I also want to stress that we are committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales. Many of the things we are doing to pull costs out of the business today set us up for savings in the future. We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts. Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.171 compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.33 times compare to 2.12 during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares. Over the last four quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.5 billion in common shares, pay $438 million in dividends, invest $3.4 billion in capital, and merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment grade rating. Return on invested capital for the first quarter, on a rolling four quarter basis, was 12.75%. On the labor relations front, we are currently negotiating agreements with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Dallas and our Food 4 Less Warehouse Stores in Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger’s financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger’s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, and enhance job security, for our associates. Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of this year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we’re seeing. As Rodney said, there is a lot of change in the retail food industry. That, coupled with the transition from deflation to inflation creates a challenging operating environment. The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel. Grocery was essentially flat during the quarter but had fluctuations up and down during it. Meat continued its deflationary trends. And produce, while deflationary for the quarter, showed inflation in the last four weeks of the first quarter and pharmacy was inflationary. As a result we increased our expectations for LIFO to $80 million; a $55 million increase over our initial expectations. We have also made some incremental investments in price in certain markets that had very hot features on milk and eggs. While this affects gross margin in the short-term, it is less expensive than regaining a customer’s loyalty. These two, plus the incremental investments in hours and wages, are the primary factors causing us to lower our guidance for the year. Our GAAP net earnings per diluted share guidance for 53 weeks is now $1.74 to $1.79. Our adjusted net earnings guidance range is $2 to $2.05. The previous adjusted net earnings guidance range was $2.21 to $2.25. See Form 8-K we filed this morning for additional information on guidance. Because this is an unusual year, we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate, as we’ve done in the past. For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the second quarter to be down compared to last year, the third quarter to be up slightly compared to last year, and the fourth quarter to be flat, excluding the 53rd week. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of flat to 1% growth for 2017. And we continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Over the long term, we remain committed to achieving net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend. Now, I’ll turn it back to Rodney.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are making the investments necessary to continue being the best food retailer in the country. We know there is a lot of upheaval in the food retail industry. Our strategy is to focus on our customers as their wants and needs change, we’ll be right there with them. We are confident that we will continue winning with our people, our food, and the customer experience, and we will not lose on price. Now, we look forward to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Heinbockel: So guys, just to start off, if you think – is there any way to quantify maybe directionally the investments in labor, in SG\u0026A versus the investments in price? Labor being some multiples of the investment in price or maybe it's equally split. And then when you think about the investments in price, is a lot of that proactive on your part? You talked about dairy or is that more reactive given what competition is doing?\nRodney McMullen: I'll start and Mike just fill in, the mix between labor and price as you look forward, I would think it's probably pretty close to 50-50 plus or minus 10%. In terms of price, there would be – as you know, we would not be leaning on price as a strategy, but we're not going to let somebody have price. Now if you look at some of the competitive changes and what we see going on in those situations, we would be proactive versus reactive. And Mike anything you want to add to both of those comments?\nMichael Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. And the whole trick here, John, is how quickly the lines cross on our price investments create more gross profit margin dollars. And as we said in the prepared remarks, there's really two things relative to the labor, one is adding some hours to certain service departments as well as increase in starting wages, which we believe over time will reduce our turnover, which has a great payback when we can have a higher retention of our associates who then are more productive and give a better shopping experience. So that one has a little bit longer runway relative to when we see the benefits of those investments.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then as a follow-up, if you think about what's different versus March, is it primarily the cadence of reflation? And then as you think about – it does sound like you do expect higher inflation this year than you had before, you didn't reflect that in your comp. Is that just higher cost inflation offset by price investments gets you kind of to a zero net impact from that?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. The biggest thing, if you look in terms of anticipation of identical sales going forward and the improvement of that, we would expect that improvement will continue, but the improvement will be a little bit slower than what we had expected. From an inflation standpoint, Mike, went into a little bit of detail on the LIFO, but that would be a big chunk, obviously the change in LIFO affected, I think, what, Mike, about $0.04 a share as well.\nMichael Schlotman: Yes, Rodney, $0.035, $0.04 in that range. John, it's not necessarily that it’s dramatically different today than we’re expecting, but when we look forward based on the movements we’re seeing in the lot of the underlying commodities. We do think there could be a little more inflation by the end of the year than we originally thought, but the accounting convention is whatever your year-end estimate is, you expense that ratably throughout the year. So it's really more reflective of where we think the end of the year is going to be not necessarily what happened in the first quarter, but we’re required to ratably expense that over the year.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks. Couple questions, I guess, in general since you are taking the opportunity to lower guidance – I guess I have two questions, one is why not take the opportunity to widen the range to give yourself a little more wiggle room? But, I guess, more importantly why wouldn't you have lower guidance more because if I look at your revised guidance, I still would say this seems pretty optimistic, especially given the competitive landscape has only really just begun to heat up. And within your guidance, originally, there were some assumption that there would be operating expense opportunities and it now sounds like that’s off the table which makes me even more confused about how we get to the full-year numbers?\nMichael Schlotman: We talked about all of those and deciding exactly where to set the guidance range. We spend a lot of time taking where we are today, looking at the forecast for the rest of the year, trying to understand the gives and takes and settled on the $2 to $2.05. A wider range, perhaps we could have done that. The only answer I had to that is we decided that we feel good about the range we put out there. We do feel good about the traction we are getting in ID sales that we think will help us support that ID guidance range. Relative to the operating cost reductions, I think – I don't have any concern that we aren’t going to continue to get the operating cost reductions we're getting. We have made an independent decision to add some service hours to some departments as well as in some markets increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have, which hurts the customer experience as well as creates its own cost in friction when you are constantly hiring training people. We didn’t do that across the country. It's in select markets, but it's not an inexpensive proposition. So we try to factor all of those in. In fact, what we call enabler savings are actually pretty close to tracking to exactly what we expected in total to save on our cost savings initiatives for the year.\nRodney McMullen: And couple of other things, Karen to – and Mike and I both mentioned that our identical sales continue to improve and we would expect that trend to continue. If you look at quarter-to-date and realize it's only three weeks plus a few days, we would be higher than the midpoint of the range that we gave for the year and that’s continued to improve over the first quarter and the first quarter was an improvement over the fourth quarter and it improved during the quarter. And then Mike’s point on expenses, there were some items where it's more of a one-time type of expense item. If you look at some of the changes in the logistics and some other places, we would expect as we get throughout the year that some of the investments we've made it will flip, so you won’t have the start-up costs. And then if you look at the digital, obviously you have a lot of start-up costs initially when you turn on digital in the store, and if you look at the maturity of those stores over time that becomes a tailwind versus a headwind.\nKaren Short: Okay. But just so I understand in terms of the operating expense reductions that you’ve identified that we did not see any of that really in this quarter, but we will see more in the second, third and fourth?\nRodney McMullen: I would say we saw some in this quarter and what we have saved in the quarter and the run rate we have for the year is right in line with what our original expectation in our business plan is. There were other – as I said that the hours and the dollars investment in starting wages were something that was incremental to the plan, but we think it's prudent to do that. We try to run the business dynamically and not sit back and say, well, it's not in the plan, so even though we think it's good, we're not going to do it and sometimes those are pluses and sometimes those are minuses. The investments we made in milk and eggs do not lose the customers to people trying to draw our customers into the store. That by itself, if milk and eggs were normal kinds of retails, so we probably would have had positive IDs in the first quarter not negative, which also affected gross margins in the first quarter. So there's always gives and takes, but we – the thing we're trying to get across is we've made some conscious decisions to make an incremental investments in our Customer 1st Strategy, plus the effect of [Indiscernible] and higher LIFO charge.\nKaren Short: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Schlotman: Thanks Karen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nZachary Fadem: Hey. Good morning, guys. Is there any color you can provide on the ID sales impact from digital orders at this point? I believe you mentioned you doubled your digital sales, so when looking at your data, how are you thinking about what's incremental versus what might be coming at the expense of in-store volumes?\nMichael Schlotman: Yes. It’s a great question Zach and it's – one of those it's always hard to answer, because you don't know what a customer would have done. The best we can tell, if you would give a range of between 40% to 60%, you’re probably within that range, but it is a hard, hard number to guesstimate, because you really don't know for sure – incremental or that you would have guided anyway either way.\nZachary Fadem: 40% to 60% incremental you said?\nMichael Schlotman: Yes.\nZachary Fadem: Okay.\nRodney McMullen: It is clear that those ClickList customers spend incremental dollars with us. To put your finger into the exact number would they have grown their loyalty with us without ClickList perhaps, but you try to take the household trends as a whole and see where they’ve been going and where they are today.\nZachary Fadem: And is it large enough to say that it's having a meaningful impact on the ID sales line yet?\nRodney McMullen: No, when you look at the total, the cost of the startup would be a lot more painful than the tailwind from it. But as you know when we merged with Harris Teeter, Harris Teeter, have been doing it for 10 years and when you look at the maturity that we are having with the Kroger versus the maturity that Harris Teeter had the maturity would be very similar, but it's a headwind for while.\nZachary Fadem: Okay. And I also wanted to address the headlines around all of the Lidl, conceptually how do you think about the role of the hard discounters in the U.S. and how that compares relative to the UK? And in your mind, what are the structural differences between the two markets that you would call out and given that, do you think that those guys would have the same competitive advantages here versus the UK market, any thoughts on that?\nRodney McMullen: Yes, exactly a lot of the question – couple of things for sure. One, just obviously the sheer size of the countries are different. I think the biggest structural – I guess two big structural differences, if you look at the cost that it takes to operate a supermarket in the U.S., it's meaningfully less than the UK. If you look at the price spreads that they're able to achieve in the UK versus the U.S., the price spreads isn't as much either. So you have both from a cost standpoint and a retail advantage for the customer standpoint, not as big as spread. Also if you look at the base experience of the supermarket in the U.S., we would typically offer more services in terms of every show would have a butcher that's there ready to help. The produce would be much more variety fresher. So there is a lot of aspects from the experience standpoint that would be different in the U.S. than the UK as well.\nZachary Fadem: Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate the time guys.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nKenneth Goldman: Rodney, one of the first things you said and I'll paraphrase was that the environment for food retail has changed, so I guess I’m curious why was it surprising given that to see these hot promotional prices on milk and eggs, shouldn't that have been sort of expected given that the environment has changed or maybe you were talking about something different, which is why I’m asking the question? And I guess for my follow-up, I'm curious what is in your guidance in terms of what you're assuming for competitive pricing as we look ahead because if things do get worse and as Karen Short was pointing out, they likely will in terms of competition. I just want to understand what you guys are thinking, and how much that's factored into your numbers at this point?\nRodney McMullen: Okay. In terms of the environment is changing, I wouldn't tie directly to milk and eggs. To me that's just one example. But as you know people are changing the way they eat and we're committed and we will support the customer in changing the way they eat. So if you think about the comments on prepared, if you think about the comments on digital and using where our customer can engage with us digitally or in-store, what we find is a customer does both. So it's all of those things together, when I talk about the way customers are eating is changing and we intend to be there and take care of the customer, the way they change. In terms of guidance, Michael you…\nMichael Schlotman: Again in response to Karen’s question, you never know when somebody in select markets is going to run some hot feature, and you have to make independent decisions as those features hit the street. Is it somebody just run an ad for a couple of weeks trying to get some business in the store or they going to do something longer term. And when those kinds of ad stay there for a little bit longer, particularly when it's two important commodities like milk and eggs, ultimately we're going to react and not allow our customers to think they have to go somewhere else to get the best value for those kinds of products. Just so happens those two commodities are big commodities and its expensive when hot features hit versus some other commodities and to say we do or don’t have something exactly built into our business plan. So that's difficult to say, but we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores.\nRodney McMullen: That's our best guess in terms of what we see happening going forward in terms of at this point in time.\nKenneth Goldman: Can I just sneak one quick one and to make sure I understand is the message of then that and Mike and Rod that is helpful, but is the message of that you can't really predicted, so you're not necessarily factoring in as a general rule, more competitive prices or is the message maybe that you are, but it's harder to be that specific about it?\nMichael Schlotman: I think we all believe that the industry is going to continue to get more competitive because every year, it does get more competitive. I think the price investments that we've made so far from our original pricing plan are taking good hold and good effect and we always still dollars in and to try to allow us to react to competitive pressures. So I think the guidance where we've lowered it to certainly have some [indiscernible], everything that may happen. As Rodney said, it’s our best guess at this point in time.\nKenneth Goldman: Understood, thank you very much.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks Ken.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nErica Eiler: Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I guess should the environment remain challenging from here. Can you maybe just talk about your flexibility to further reduce CapEx and perhaps redeployed buybacks or other avenues to increase shareholder value?\nRodney McMullen: But as you know from a capital investment standpoint, we continue to adjust and over the last year we've reduced the amount that we invest in store increasingly invest increase the amount we're spending from a digital standpoint and infrastructure standpoint. We will always want to keep our stores up-to-date and fresh in terms of the four walls themselves. What we find is that what the customer wants and needs are, it’s constantly changing, so some of the things that I talked about will need to make changes in the store to support that. If we would believe that we can continue to reduce the amount of capital we're spending, if we're not getting a return on that capital, we would still be looking at it like a hawk in terms of every dollar we spend are we getting a return for that dollar that we're spending and over time does that create value. As for some reason, it doesn't. We would reduce – we have continued to increase the focus on the infrastructure, digital and some of the other parts and deemphasized stores in terms of the net new stores. I don’t know Mike, anything you….\nMichael Schlotman: [Indiscernible]\nErica Eiler: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just switching gears to private label. You talked a quite about – bit about private label in your prepared remarks, seems that a lot of groceries out there or increasingly pushing private label lately, some cases select players that even lowering prices on private label. So are you at all seeing step up efforts from the leading CPG players to support there products whether it's through more promotional dollars or through other avenues? It just seems that there would be much more of sense of urgency at this point, given what seems to be this increase retailer focus on private label?\nMichael Schlotman: Yes, well our brand has been incredibly important to Kroger since the founding of the Company. And the research that we did last year, we want to make sure that we weren't just biased because we're so close to it and we did the research with our customers and our customers gave us glowing feedback on how strong our brands were, how great the products were in a blind panel. So they didn’t know it was us. If you look at our Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic, we just crushed the competitors in that space. So for us, our brands has always been massively important and we will have a world-class our brand approach and it's important for our customers, it's important in terms of being able to make money as well. So we don't look at it in terms of trying to do something versus a CPG, we really look at it is our brand and building our brands and doing the things that customer wants.\nErica Eiler: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nStephen Tanal: Thanks guys. Good morning.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nStephen Tanal: I'm sort of thinking through the cut to the guide, I’m curious to know how you’re planning food margins for the balance of the year relative to Q1. Do you think the year-on-year gross margin pressure is bottomed are you planning for that to get worse?\nMichael Schlotman: Yes, I would say that when we look at gross margins overall, there's a variety of factors that wind up going into that. I think you'll continue to see us over time, reduced gross margins. If you think about my prepared comments over the last 12 years or 14 years, we've invested $3.8 billion in price by the drop we've made in gross margin. And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down, it’s typically what happens in that any segment of retailing to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter. I probably wouldn't get that specific, but certainly when you look at it over time. We built our business model, assuming that gross margins will go down. We need stronger IDs and we've had the last few quarters and we need to get back of the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin. Obviously as I said in my prepared remarks, these are representative of the results we expect to deliver over time. But every once in a while you run through cycles, where you have to step back and adjust many of the metrics inside the company and we feel that we've done a good job of react and I'll sensibly and proactively to the environment around us, both from a labor standpoint, from a price investment standpoint and what makes sense to grow the business for the long-term.\nStephen Tanal: I guess two related sort of follow-up questions. The first would be the milk and eggs example. How widespread is that issue? And the second would be maybe qualitatively, as you think about the guidance and passing through the cost inflation that you're seeing, what's generally built in, like how long are you sort of guiding, so that you can hold the line on price longer than you think others well or is that a little different for any reason?\nMichael Schlotman: Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, accepting categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making. You typically won't see us anymore maybe in the 1990s we did this. But you won't see the kind of reaction where we have very, very hot features that in the end don’t drive any kind of loyalty in your store and just tries to drive foot traffic and get them to buy other things. Will we react to those types of things and make investments, so that they don’t attracting of our customer stores, absolutely we will. But I think if you look over time, we’ll continue to be proactive on how we make the investments.\nStephen Tanal: Okay, fair enough. And just lastly on meal kits I know it was about four stores some weeks ago, how fast is that being rolled out? How fast can it be rolled out and if you give us a feel for how incremental the sales are maybe how your pricing is versus kind of the group of ingredients in those kits that would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nMichael Schlotman: Yes, a great question that I won't get into all the specifics because obviously competitors would appreciate that knowledge as well. What we're finding is the quality of that meal is the same as going to a restaurant and getting the meal, but people like to prepare something at home and they find it easy and they love the variety that we offer. So lot of the price comparisons is what the prices versus going to a restaurant, but being able to do it at home and when it takes to 20 minutes, it's just as fast as Kroger’s that is going to a restaurant and going through all that household when you're at a restaurant, and we're getting great feedback. We’ll continue to roll it out based on the ability for the facilities to handle the volume, and so far it's been very good and we appreciate and looking forward to work out.\nStephen Tanal: Okay. Thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to kind of like broaden out a little bit and try to understand kind of where you guys think your business is and I heard Mike talking about gross margin pressure. As we look at the market, it seems like it's almost like the headline would be more Amazon moving into consumables, more Walmart price investments, more Walmart click and collect, more Aldi, more Lidl. And so with this natural pressure on gross margins there's also seemingly a natural pressure on cost. And so as you look forward, I know you guys kind of reiterated your 8% to 11% EPS growth rate. I’m just trying to understand over a number of years, how that's going to be possible in this environment. And do you need to make more aggressive, more offensive moves here with the business given this environment?\nRodney McMullen: It's really making sure that we're using the advantages we have, obviously the data that we have. Our average customer only has to drive a mile to get one of our stores. So it's using that personalization to connect with the customer directly on a one-on-one basis and having where they can engage with us anyway they want to, so if they want to pick up their groceries, if they want to delivered or if they want to shop and go at the old fashion way for lack of a better word. We continue to add services and all of those services as part of the model in terms of making it easy place to stop, so if you think about fuel and some of the others. So it's really the sum of all those pieces together that we're offering and we're doing it in a seamless way. So I don't disagree with the more and more and more, but there's also things that are a huge advantage for us. And when you look at all those things when a customer comes into our stores, we still give him a great experience on a friendly face. We have incredibly fresh product and it's important for us to continue to improve on those aspect because that's what will be a point of difference.\nScott Mushkin: So my follow-up question would be regarding the scale, this Kroger have enough scale in your minds to compete in this environment against the likes of Walmart and Amazon, which are just produce tremendous amounts of cash both companies. So, I was wondering as you look at the business, obviously you’re a large company, but a lot of investments need to be made, do you need more scale?\nRodney McMullen: From everything - from our perspective, we would have plenty of scale and certainly $115 billion revenue Company, we would have the scale. The other thing is, if you look at like our own brands, the strength of our own brands and the strength of the experience the customers enjoy, all those things obviously add to that scale as well.\nScott Mushkin: All right. Thanks guys. Good luck. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrew Wolf: Hi, good morning. Thanks.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning.\nAndrew Wolf: So I just want to clarify, you did say tonnage was positive, but if you just take out the inflation or the deflation rate, it looks like it might have slowed sequentially.\nRodney McMullen: I didn't catch the first part of your question, what was tonnage…\nAndrew Wolf: Just want to know if the tonnage slowed and if so – tonnage growth, you said tonnage growth is positive, but just doing given the numbers you provide us it looks as if it slowed sequentially.\nRodney McMullen: Yes. I’m not going to get into – we typically don't give exact tonnage numbers and if you at ID sales compared to inflation, deflation it really skewed results when you try to add those two numbers together because of the mix of product that wind up being inside of those categories. When you have inflation in certain categories and deflation in other categories, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison. Just stepping back from exact tonnage and things like that when you have the number of loyal households we have and you add 3.2% growth in the loyal households and your ID sales with your loyal households is on a positive trend. Those are all great signs of help for our business over time. Without giving – we're very happy with our unit growth in the first quarter let’s just stay with that.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay, great. Last quarter you said whatever market – the market share growth at least as you've given it out annually was a little less in the 2016 than it had been in prior years. What I am really trying to get to is – in last quarter you said that was more store-based, your traditional store base competitors running better stores. And meanwhile, you’re talking more about the changing environments, so I just want to check in with you is that still what mainly you see is creating a heightened competitive environment here? Or is it starting to be, as [Scott] was alluding to what's going on digitally whether it's Amazon or other offers?\nRodney McMullen: On the estimating market share as you know is always difficult, but our growth in the first quarter, certainly on the analysis would indicate that our market share growth in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter. And as Mike said, we're pleased with what our unit growth was. We're pleased with our improvement in trend and we're pleased with the improvement in market share trends as well and the lower household growth.\nAndrew Wolf: Great. Well that's encouraging. Do you want to comment on weather – where you’re seeing competitive – it's obvious the new entrants coming in the market, but some of them are store-based folks like Lidl and Aldi and some are online like Amazon? So just in terms of what you're reacting to and so forth or how do you see things in the future? What is your perspective? Is it still going to be a store-based competitive landscape or do you see being digital including perhaps home delivery with certain click and collect more of Kroger's future really what you're stepping up to?\nRodney McMullen: Yes. If you look, we really see the customer – all our strategies and things are where do we anticipate the customer going. Everything that we could see and see and doing what we're building our infrastructure for is to be able to serve the customer the way they want to be served. And everything that we can see, we find that the customer likes the combination of everything versus just one approach and we continue to partner with third-party on doing deliveries, we have that in a couple of markets and we continue to expand that. We continue to expand the number of items that are offered and obviously we continue to expand the number of ClickList ExpressLane stores we have. But everything that we can see the customer wants to shop on their terms, the way they want to, but they still for certain items like to come into a physical store, because they like to interact with people. And we think it's incredibly important to continue to have a strong physical presence, but it's the sum of all parts rather than just each one individually.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank for the color. I just want to follow-up if I could on the regional price and hot pricing in dairy. Could you tell us what regions is that more in the east where is a proactive to Lidl's entry more so than not and just generally how widespread that is?\nRodney McMullen: Yes, I won’t comment on exactly where we sell, other than it was not concentrated only there.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nVincent Sinisi: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just go back to the pricing philosophy, obviously been talked about a lot, but I think warranted, given the fact that for investors today probably the line that jumped out most within the release was we will not lose on price. So you talked about obviously being – certainly a part of that is proactive, I'm sure some of it and given markets is reactive, but can you just give us a little bit better sense on kind of the true kind of philosophy around balancing that kind of strict price versus obviously a lot of the other factors that Kroger has going for it and kind of who that maybe kind of most aimed after, that'd be great? Thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Yes, I think it's important for people not to over play the price comment. As you know, we do a ton of work on understanding where the customer wants and needs are, and we're incredibly focused on differentiating our experience versus our competitors in terms of the service our associates provide the products and the quality of the products, the quality especially in the fresh areas and produce and meat and seafood and our deli, and the shopping experience itself, so how long does it take me to get into the store? How long does it take me to get through the checkout line? What type of experience? Those are the things that we're focused on, and that we will differentiate ourselves. We're increasingly differentiating ourselves in terms of the ability to do engage with us anyway you want. Price, we're just making sure we don't lose customers because of price. So it's really – those pieces together, is where we're focused on and focused on delivering for the customer.\nVincent Sinisi: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up to that, maybe more on the promotional environment and obviously a big kind of more theoretical question for everyone on the call is, how much of this is more kind of permanent shifts and pricing versus more of just kind of that weekly blockbuster promotions kind of like what you mentioned. So I guess how do you think about particularly in the second half of this year with the commodity costs, showing signs of improvement? How much of kind of maybe some of those this weekly promotion did you expect on your side to kind of moderate versus how much of this may just be more kind of permanent in nature? Thanks a lot.\nMichael Schlotman: When you look at how people are going to promote and what will be features are going to be, I wouldn't have enough time to step back and think about how our merchants develop their marketing plan, they’re well out, the multiple weeks out. We certainly make assumptions about how customers or how other competitors reacting around holidays, how they may react in weeks, during the summer when there's a lot of vacations going on and maybe fewer people at home shopping and what kind of promotions they may do. But to be able to sit here and say, this is exactly what we're expecting from a promotional standpoint will be very difficult to say I have X, Y or Z built into the plan. Other than we know there is always going to be markets and there always are markets where there are a lot of hot features going on. There's other markets that are kind of in the middle, there is high low kind of activity kind of normal traditional grocery store pricing. And then there is other markets that are relatively benign where you go back to daily that fortunately for us, we have the number of markets we're in the breath of those markets that not every market is high for competitive at the same time in some of the ones that aren't quite as competitive help offset that. So to sit here and try to project what the competitive environment are more specifically, the promotional environment maybe would probably not be any significantly prudent.\nVincent Sinisi: Now that's helpful to hear as well. So best of luck. Thanks.\nRodney McMullen: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nKelly Bania: Hi, just some more questions on margins and the price investments. I guess it seems fair to ask where – of these hot ads are of these traditional supermarkets. Are there any different kind of behavior that you would expect to get better over the next coming quarters from these competitors with these hot ads and I guess as you respond to them, how much of your response in terms of price investments is going in personalized discounts versus your everyday pricing? And are you seeing any different changes in terms of what you would expect in terms of elasticity to those price investments that you are making? Thank you.\nMichael Schlotman: I'm not sure exactly where to start on all those questions. At the end of the day, we always assume this industry is going to get more competitive quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out and unfortunately I guess we're really disappointed with the result of our expectation and that's that – it's always been a competitive market. It's always been a competitive industry. In our view, it's going to continue to be competitive. There are bursts of time where things heat up and then burst of times where cool down and we know over time that if somebody runs a high feature over the course of the weekend that's one thing. If somebody appears to be try and to put a stake in the ground on big volume important commodities to drive volume into their stores, the best thing we can do to counteract that is as Rodney say, not lose on price of that commodity, because that takes the advantage away from them and it doesn't get any of our loyal customers or any of our customers, any reason to go anywhere else to shop. And you have to make judgments throughout the course of a year and a quarter of – is this a short-term thing somebody is doing that you can not necessarily this way, but by and large ignore or is this something you need to react to? How do you balance that with planned price promotions you have? Nobody on the call can see the advantage we create with our loyal household with the My Magazine, Rodney talked about or there were 6 million individualized offers in the first quarter alone, but offered those households a different price and everybody sees on their shelf edge. We do that without creating any kind of price impression amongst our competitors because they don't know we're doing it. But that's the way to be able to reward and give a better price to our most loyal customers without putting it on the front page of an ad and perhaps us causing something like that to happen. So we're constantly using those kind of advantages we have primarily through 84.51° to figure out how to reward our most loyal customers the best.\nRodney McMullen: The only other thing I would add Kelly to Mike's point is if you look, typically you'll have consolidation and consolidation happens in spurts and everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out. And it's one of the things that we think is incredibly important to have the scale that we have and the diversity across the whole country that we have because it allows us to continue to do what's right for our customers. We will continue to work on improving the basic operations and by doing those things. The shareholders continue to get a great return over time as well.\nKelly Bania: Great and I guess my follow-up to that would be just in this environment, are you thinking about M\u0026A any differently that all given what you just said?\nMichael Schlotman: I wouldn't say we're thinking about M\u0026A any differently at all. I do agree with Rodney’s assessment of consolidation. I think you'll continue to see us have the opportunity to increase our footprint in markets we're already in by the consolidation of competitors we're going by the wayside, you saw the news reports from earlier in the week in Indiana. And I think there will be a further opportunities like that going throughout the course of the next few years. It's one of the reasons why Rodney’s comment on reducing our capital expenditure on increasing our footprint. It doesn't worry me too much over the next few years, because I think I can lower my CapEx invested in things are going to drive sales and reduce operating costs and increase my footprint and prices below what it would cost me to build from the ground up. And when they get into those kinds of situations, it sites you really want the fit rate rather than buying an entire chain and trying to do something with that. So I feel really good about that part of what's going on around this.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nRodney McMullen: And we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nCharles Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.\nRodney McMullen: Good morning, Chuck.\nCharles Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about how prepared foods did just as a category all the forms and which you sell in market prepared foods did versus a year-ago?\nRodney McMullen: It continued to grow nicely versus a year-ago. It would be one of the strongest departments and it's one of those things, as you know we think it's more and more customers will go in that direction and as you know we went to the upside to hire some talent there and we really feel good about the opportunity in terms of the growth opportunities and we love the progress we're making.\nCharles Cerankosky: Is that an area that is going to get more capital dollars when Mike spoke earlier of infrastructure spending?\nRodney McMullen: Yes, they will get more capital dollars, but more importantly, it will get more attention and just the discretionary effort of organization, we will. It's not as capital intensive to make the changes we need to make there. The key thing is changing, and keeping the menus fresh and up to-date and the attention that we spend in that area.\nCharles Cerankosky: And then switching to some of the offsets, Mike hinted about operating cost, projects to reduce operating expenses that might be overshadowed this year by some of the wage investments, but could you highlight some of the projects that are going on please?\nMichael Schlotman: I wouldn't get through specific. One of the bigger areas that just always particularly of late, we have a lot of projects going on in/and around shrink, some tests going on and a handful of markets trying to reduce the trends on shrink. It's early on in those handfuls of markets, but early signs are the customers doing seems to be encouraging and hopefully as we get to the end of the year and it starts to be – end of the year and then the next year something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of the headwind.\nCharles Cerankosky: But headwind, you mean the wage investments this year are going to cover up a lot of the other expense reduction efforts?\nMichael Schlotman: Or just shrink not being exactly where we wanted in these projects being able to turn the trend on shrink.\nCharles Cerankosky: Gotcha. All right, thank you.\nRodney McMullen: Thanks, Charles. End of Q\u0026A\nRodney McMullen: Appreciate it. Before we end today’s call, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, the changes that we talked about today and the direction we're headed in, we're making those changes proactively. And it's really based on where we see the customer is going and we think it's incredibly important to do those changes in advance and we’re massively excited about the growth opportunities for the business going forward, I am we really feel good about our team in terms of the opportunities and taking advantage of those. So I want to make that. And then I also as you know, I always like to share some comments with our associates listening in. As you’ve heard us describe during this call, we’re focused on executing our Customer 1st Strategy and living our Company’s purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Feed the Human Spirit is our purpose because both our customers and you, our associates, told us it resonates powerfully with you, and also because it is authentic to Kroger it’s who we are. We’ve been living our purpose in large ways and small for more than 134 years. Whether it is through providing a billion meals to Feed Hungry Families in our neighborhoods over the last four years, committing to being a zero waste company by 2020 or simply extending a smile or a helping hand to a customer, we and you make the world a better place one associate, one customer, one community at a time. Thank you for all you do every day for our customers and each other. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

Listeners who do not have a copy of the quarter ended June 30, 2017 press release or the presentation may obtain the copy by visiting the investors section of the company's website. Now I will turn the call over to CEO, Guy Sella.\nGuy Sella: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our conference call. I'm happy to report that we concluded our second quarter with a strong results. We are reporting record revenues for the quarter of $136.1 million, gross margin of 34.6%, GAAP net income of $22.5 million and a record non-GAAP net income of $25.8 million. We also reported a record cash flow from operations of $31.6 million. Let's look at what has driven these positive results. Our revenues see a record high this quarter, and we continue to execute on our business plan in all parameters. We increased our gross margin and profitability, while ASP erosion was within our plan. This increase in gross margin is namely a result of effective cost-reduction of which continues to be a focus for our R\u0026D team, together with efficiency associated with increased revenues, translating into lower per unit production cost. In the second quarter, we shipped 563 megawatts of AC nameplate inverters, approximately 274 megawatts of which will ship to North America. Overall we shipped 1.8 million power optimizers, and 75,000 inverters, yet another record. I want to take this opportunity to highlight some aspects of our business and to address some additional noteworthy measures. Our record revenues this quarter were driven by a modest increase in our North American sales, coupled with significant growth in Europe, in particular, from Germany and the Netherlands. In addition, we continue to see positive momentum in other markets such as Japan, Australia and India, where our newly established team is engaged in developing large commercial opportunities. As in last quarter, our commercial sales continue to grow even slightly more than the very nice growth in our residential sales. In at the last quarters, as we continue to increase our R\u0026D teams and related expenditure, which allows us to continue to drive down product cost and more important, to introduce new product. This quarter, we announced our new S-Series Power Optimizer. The new S-Series Power Optimizer is approximately 40% better in power density, and introduces a new innovative safety feature that extends safety to the connector level. The new safety feature is designed to detect heat abnormalities and initiate shutdown before in altitudes [ph] in order to prevent potential fires. This S-Series Power Optimizer is expected to be available in 2018. We also unveiled our larger capacities Three Phase Inverters. The up to 100 kilowatts inverter solution enabled reduced installation time and cost, while also providing smart energy management control. The new product opens new opportunities for large commercial project for the company, and even meets the needs of large utility project, where we can continue to deliver our advantage in system design, added production and safety at the competitive price. A few weeks ago, at Intersolar North America, we announced the world's first Inverter Integrated Electrical Vehicle Charger. By supplementing grid power with speedy power, our Level 2 EV charger offers charging up to 6 times faster than a standard Level 1 of charger with its innovative solar boost mode. Integrating an EV charger into our inverter further strategy of extending inverter functionality from pure solar inversion and monitoring to turning an inverter into the central component for home energy management applications. This is part of our longer term plan for growth and business extension. Our HD-Wave inverter's rollout is complete and now available worldwide. Market acceptance for this game-changing inverter is strong. A noteworthy side, since the beginning of Q2, we had been seen strong evidence of component allocation issue, mainly for power components used in midsize Three Phase Inverters. This phenomena, together with the increasing demand for our product and the expansion of our product line, puts more pressure on our component supply chain. We are mitigating this pressure by expanding our approved vendor list. But in the near future, we do expect that we will have some increase in our shipment cost and longer lead times in order to meet at the higher demand for our products. The competitive landscape continues to be a source of much discussion in the industry this quarter. We are still not seeing any new products or players in the market and remain confident in our technology leadership and the intellectual property we have to defend it. We are also confident that our increased cash position, which now exceeds $274 million, put us in a strong position to continue to develop new product and expand our business, both geographically and into other aspects of energy management. I would like to conclude with brief look at our bottom line numbers. Our non-GAAP net income was $25.8 million, and we generated record cash from operation - of operations amounting to $31.6 million. As we have proven over the past quarters, our financial strength position us well to continue to increase market share in the U.S, Europe and other global markets, even in market that are going through change and challenges. It is also enable us to leverage our very strong research and development team to bring new product to current and new markets, while managing the various effective cost-reduction plan. And with this, I hand the speaker over to Ronen who will review our financial results.\nRonen Faier: Thank you, Guy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before starting the review of our financial results for the second quarter of 2017, I would like to remind listeners that while the overview will be on a GAAP basis, in certain cases, I will be discussing non-GAAP numbers and measures, which exclude the impact of stock-based compensation and deferred tax, as well as non-GAAP earnings per share. Total reconsideration of the pro forma to GAAP results discussed on this call is available on our website and in the press release issued today. Now let's start with our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. Total revenues were $136.1 million, compared to $115.1 million last quarter, and $124.8 million in the prior year period. Revenue growth this quarter was mainly attributed to our growth outside of the United States. While sales in the United States modestly grew this quarter, Europe and the rest of the world represented 45.9% of our revenues. This quarter, only one customer exceeded 10% of revenues, in our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 59.5% of revenues. Gross margin for the quarter was 34.6% comparable 33.6% in the prior quarter, and 31.4% in the same quarter last year. A relatively stable price environment, combined with our continuous cost-reduction, increased sales of HD-Wave inverter is related to other products, and stronger euro compared to the U.S. dollar, were all contributing factors to our improved or gross margins. Moving to operating expenses. Research and development expenses were $12.7 million, an increase of 11% compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 38% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is in line with our continued investment in new product development and focus on cost reduction. Our R\u0026D team headcount is constantly growing, enabling us to expand teams and expedite development of new products. In addition, this quarter shows slightly higher increase in expenses since annual salary adjustments are implemented at the beginning of the second quarter. As we mentioned in the past, we intend to continue and invest our resources to expand research and development teams in the near future. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $12 million, an increase of 11% compared to the previous quarter, a 34% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Other than seasonal growth usually seen in the second and third quarter due to the timing of the large solar industry trade shows, the industry -- the increase in this quarter represents our continued investment in our in and outside of the United States to support our growing business. G\u0026A expenses were $3.3 million for the quarter, a decrease of 26% from the prior quarter, and an increase of 6% year-over-year. As a reminder, last quarter, we needed to increase our accrual for doubtful accounts, mainly due to the uninsured portion of AR balance related to the bankruptcy of Sungevity [ph]. In total, operating expenses for the second quarter were $28 million or 20.5% of revenues. Compared to $26.7 million or 23. revenues in the prior quarter, and $21.2 million or 17% of revenues for the same quarter last year. The result of the increased revenues and gross margin and the reduced increase in operating expenses, is that operating income for the quarter was $19.1 million compared with $12 million in the previous quarter and $17.9 million for the same period last year. Financial income this quarter was $3.6 million compared to $1.4 million in the previous quarter, and A financial expenses of $0.5 million for the same period last year. The relatively high financial income is a result mainly of the euro revaluation against the U.S. dollar that is combined with higher euro denominated accounts receivable and cash balances, resulting from our sales growth in Europe. In addition, the financial income includes clothes increased income from investments in marketable securities. Taxable income this quarter was $0.2 million, compared with a tax benefit of $0.8 million and tax expenses of $0.1 million for the same period last year. The relatively low tax rate this quarter is mainly attributed to the taxed holiday for which the Israeli subsidiary is benefited until June 2018; changes in our deferred tax assets as a result of the increasing R\u0026D expenditures, and favorable changes in the applicable tax rate for technological companies in Israel. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $22.5 million compared to a GAAP net income of $14.2 million in the previous quarter, and a GAAP net income of $17.3 million for the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $25.8 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $16.5 million in the previous quarter and of $19.9 million for the same quarter last year GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $0.50 for the first quarter -- for the second quarter, compared with $0.32 in the previous quarter and $0.39 net diluted GAAP EPS for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $0.55 compared to a non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $0.36 the previous quarter, and a non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $0.44 in the same quarter last year. Turning now to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments were $274.7 million compared to $27.6 million as of March 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, we generated $31.6 million in cash flow from operations. AR balances increased nominally this year - this quarter and were $79.9 million as of June 30 compared to $79.3 million last quarter. However, this amount represents a lower DSO compared to the last quarter, mainly to -- due to a more even dissolution of sales over the quarter. As of June 30, 2017, our inventory level, net of reserve, was at $56.2 million compared with the $60.9 million in the prior quarter. Moving on to guidance for the third quarter of 2017. We expect revenues to be even in the range of $155 million to $165 million, and gross margins to be within the range of 33% to 35%. I will now turn the call over to operator to open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nVishal Shah: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Ronen, Guy, congratulations on a great quarter. First question is on the revenue outlook for the third quarter. Can you talk about where the strength is coming from? Is it still the open markets are expecting U.S. to pick up? And also, what is the kind of pricing environment, you mentioned stable pricing. I know you kind of said in the past that you expect price declines of about 10% on a year-over-year basis, is that still the case? And then finally,, what do you think the gross margin impact is from some of the recent tightness in the year, supply chain you're talking about? Thank you.\nGuy Sella: So one by one. Revenue outlook would come from the growth we believe in both U.S. and Europe. We'll know better by the end of the quarter, but I think there is a good chances that U.S. sales start to grow nicer than what we saw in Q2, but we'll know only at the end of the quarter. But we feel confident that we'll have overall growth almost in any territory. What was the second question? Pricing? We still assume - for the total year, the estimation of the 10% ASP erosion, I think we give estimation of 10% to 15% ASP erosion by the beginning of the year, it's still assumption today. But we don’t see - on the early basis, we don't see any major change. We think that the total ASP erosion will be within the range we gave you at the beginning of the year. What was the second?\nVishal Shah: Yes, the third question was around the supply-chain issues that you mentioned and the impact on gross margins.\nGuy Sella: So, I think they impact on the gross margin will be small. It still retain the 33% to 35% of that to we are giving you, which is, as you remember from a few years ago, within the estimation of how we can grow over until the end of next year to somewhere in the area of 36% to 37%. The effect will be on the higher cost of air shipments and a little bit on longer lead times, but I don't think it will influence yet any major parameter of the quarter. From the global perspective, it seems that for high-power - mainly high-power activity component and modules, there is quite several occasions situation that probably will be with us until Q2 next year. So it's something that we will have to work with and live with and overcome in the next, I believe, 3, 4 quarters.\nVishal Shah: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowan and Company.\nJeff Osborne: Hey, good afternoon. And congratulations on a strong results. A couple for me. Ronen, I was wondering, could you give us a sense on watch HD Wave penetration is as a percentage of the megawatts that were shipped in the quarter?\nRonen Faier: We are producing only HD Wave, so beside storage inverters that are few thousand [indiscernible] in Q2, 2 to 3000 inverters were storage inverters. Most of the rest is HD Wave, and it's all the one inverter we're selling, which is more or less 2/3 to 70-some-percent of the total sales of the company.\nJeff Osborne: And all the Three Phases is not HD Wave at the moment?\nRonen Faier: No, no. Three Phases is not HD Wave yet. Only by the end of 2018.\nJeff Osborne: Got it. And then how do you think about the OpEx trajectory in the second half? Certainly you’ve given guidance on the revenue and nice growth there, but just given the kind of internationalization of the company, how do we think about more feet on the street, as well as some of the product initiatives that you highlighted in Intersolar?\nGuy Sella: So I can say several things and let differentiate between R\u0026D and sales and marketing and G\u0026A. On the R\u0026D, as we mentioned in the previous calls and throughout the quarter, we believe that overall we'll try to grow by a 25% in the expenditures. However, given our financial position, usually, the problem with growing R\u0026D is not actually whether you have restrictions on the budget or not, its actually having the right people to recruit them, have them joining the company and have them become useful in the way that the organization can observe and they can basically prove themselves. And as such, while we would like to grow more than a 25% year-over-year, I believe that this 25% is the right number, simply given the fact that there is a certain amount of people that you can hire and train within a limited period of time. When you talk about sales and marketing, so first of all, the second and the third quarter are usually higher on sales and marketing because of the large trade shows, we have Intersolar and SPI, and also in other areas around the world. And we're operating in many geographies, as you can see. So usually, you see a little bit of bigger growth there, which is supposed to be much smaller in Q4. And when it comes to G\u0026A, G\u0026A is fairly stable and growing quite slowly. So because of the fact that we all – already have all of the, I would call it infrastructure needed to support the company of that side. In general, the rule of the thumb is that, on the annual basis, operating expenses as percentage of revenue should decrease in order to allow us to increase profitability. And we still believe that this will be the trajectory that we're supposed to see.\nJeff Osborne: Got it. And last question I had, just with softness or the solar market here in the US. Have any concerns about channel inventory as some of the older product or do you feel comfortable that, that's been flushed out?\nGuy Sella: We don't think that there is a higher inventory in the channel today than what it was in Q1. I think in a way, maybe the opposite is true. We do see a tendency for some people to build inventory due to [indiscernible] case. So do something that we wouldn't know on a namely basis, but we do see or do here in the market there are some people that building inventory, assuming that this will change the behavior of customers towards the end of the a. But the, in general I think see less inventory in channels that what we saw the beginning of - in similar time in Q1.\nJeff Osborne: Got it. Thanks so much.\nGuy Sella: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Strouse the JPMorgan.\nMark Strouse: Good evening. Thanks very much for taking my questions and I’ll add my congratulations as well. So can you just talk about the competitive landscape? I think you've been getting share for quite a while now. But is it fair to say that during Q2, that market share shift accelerated as some of your distress competitors, potentially became even more distressed? And then, on the flip side of that, are you seeing any signs of new competition coming in anytime in the next year or so?\nGuy Sella: So we hear the rumours that Huawei is supposed to come with a commercial inverters and optimizes. We didn't see any of this component. All we saw was mock-up [ph] in some shows. So we don't know better than you if those are just mock-up, its something will show in the market. We feel very confident with our intellectual property to protect what we invented a decade ago and leading the space with. Regarding accelerating market share, I don't think we have enough data points to confirm such a claim. I guess, we'll have to wait and see and hear a few other earning call next week. And then maybe we, you, all of us will have a better view of the exact market share. But I think that we feel very confident with our ability to take market share in the U.S. and in Europe.\nMark Strouse: Okay. Thanks, Guy. Just 1 quick follow-up if I can. What was the mix of C\u00261 during Q2? And how should we think about that trending over the next few quarters?\nRonen Faier: So all in all, it was slightly higher than in the last quarter. As we said last quarter, which was a little bit over 32% of revenues and this quarter was slightly higher, not much more. But given the fact that the growth that you saw in revenue, that means also sales on the sales group nominally. And as Guy mentioned in the previous also, we truly aim for the end of 2010 to be 50-50 percent between C\u0026I and residential, and we clearly see that C\u0026I is continuing to take more and more share of our revenues.\nMark Strouse: Okay. That’s it from me. Thank you very much.\nRonen Faier: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from John Windham with Barclays.\nJohn Windham: Hi, Guy, Ronen. Thanks for taking the question. We've done a lot of work this quarter on channel checks and the feedback on HD Wave was overwhelmingly positive. So congratulations on the product launch. Having said that, can you talk a little bit about the S-Series and where that's going to fit in the product portfolio and to more specific on when that might roll out in 2018?\nGuy Sella: So the answer we start - we'll replace in full the current optimizers. It's the new ASIC [ph] that we are operating in less for – I think close to a couple of years. It has better power to volume density, which means that it's all - in power electronics as you know, translating to cost reduction. And it has this unique feature which we think is very important. As you're probably aware of lots of problems with connector, where we can detect the connector temperature. And therefore stop the system if the temperature is going above and normal connector temperature way before an arc will start. As you understand, there are two - in 1 hand, we want to enjoy the cost reduction, on the other hand, we are hoping to be in a quarter, manufacturing the 80%, 90% of optimizer already or with always fully automatic assembly centers. So transforming those into the next generation probably will take us 3 to 4 quarters. So I would expect that we'll start to roll out the new product by Q2, and we will finish to roll it out by the end of next year.\nJohn Windham: Nice, perfect. Thank you for that.\nGuy Sella: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners.\nPhilip Shen: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter as well. As a follow-up to the ASPs question and topic. I was wondering if you might be able to split the year-on-year change that you see for resi commercial? I know you’re talking about a blended decline of 10% to 15%. But as far as you can split that up, that will be helpful? Thanks.\nRonen Faier: So I’ll try to give. We cannot split each one of them because some of the products are actually going to the same markets. But I'll try to give you a little bit of the trends that we see. So I can say that in general, there are some effects that are eventually baked into the ASP that are mostly related to mix or geographical mix. And this is the fact that, due to the higher sales that we see in Europe right now is percentage of revenue and due to the fact that the euro because much stronger than the US dollars, that means that now we actually see in some cases that the - on a dollar basis, the ASP in Europe is increasing and of course, the bigger the amount sales in Europe, the overall effect is much bigger. So if you take out all of these effects related to geographical mix and currencies that are somehow distorting the view, we generally see relatively stable ASP environments, where we see almost no market-wide changes or pressures on the ASP. There are pinpoints that we sometimes need to react or change prices based on demand or based on opportunity. But in general, we see no new competition, no new competitive price pressure, no new different products that require us to right now drop the price is. And as such, we see relatively stable ASP environments overall.\nPhilip Shen: Great. Thanks, Ronen. As a follow up to margins, I think I heard you say - I thank you said, 36% to 737% long-term gross margins. I was wondering if you might be able to expand on that, you know, back to the IPO, you guys were talking about your long-term margins being between 30% and 35% in this quarter as you're hitting close to 35%. So longer term, assuming the competitive environment stays stable, where do you think the margins could go?\nRonen Faier: So from the very first days on the road show we were very consistent. We said 32% to 37%, and this is something that, over the last 2.5 years, we reiterated that we still see as our long-term motive. In general, when we look at the gross margin it's a combination, of course, of the ASP, but also of the company's ability to drop the costs. And dropping costs mainly comes from innovation and mainly comes from the ability to execute on, I would call it magazine of cost reduction measures that we already have; where each one of these elements require R\u0026D activity that is always coming on the account of new products. So it's always a balance what you do, do you do more product development or more cost-reduction? We feel very comfortable with the 37% moving forward. Even if we see competition growing or where it is today, we believe that amount of identified cost-reduction items, especially now with HD Wave which is only at the very beginning of its way when it comes to cost reductions and the ability to continue and improve the product from the new generation of optimizers, we see a lot of it areas where we can continue into this. And as such, it seems that we can continue and drop costs out of HD. On the other hand, we see much higher than 37%, it something that is hard for us to see. Simply because of the effect of this industry did not experience something like it before, and we always believe that there is some balance between your ability to grow margins and your customer's power to try and take some of these margins away from you and move to their margin. So we are still very comfortable with the upper limit of the 37% from the last 2.5 years and we'll do everything to continue to execute on this.\nPhilip Shen: Great. One more if I way. In terms of your growth outlook. You focus of residential or you're growing your commercial. The segment that you're not in is utility scale. Can you give us an update on your ability to address utility scale? What the timing might be? What do you expect your value proposition to be? And was string inverters kind of attacking the scale market? How are you looking at that market in that segment now? And what could be the timing as to when that business could kick in?\nGuy Sella: So we started to reach, I think prices - especially with the new Jumbo Jupiter [ph] that allow us to compete on the market of industrial or utility scale project that are based on string inverter. This is a part of our core development to 2018, and I believe that the first product is a good fit. And by the end of 2018, 2019, will have a full suite of product aiming specifically for utility scale projects. And I believe that this time we'll take our share of this segment as well.\nPhilip Shen: Great. Thank you, guys. I’ll jump back in the queue.\nGuy Sella: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities.\nJoseph Osha: Hello Yes, my congratulations as well. I'm wondering if it can talk about HD Wave in a Three Phase market a bit. I heard you say late 2018. What are the key challenges here? Is it simply a case of tripling the electronics on the AC side and maybe just talk a little bit about what the advantages of HD Wave might look like in that Three-Phase market? Thank you.\nGuy Sella: The topology of HD Wave is what we believe is a much better topology It will allow you to improve efficiency to above 99%. Today, we are at around 98%, 98.5%. The difference in percentage of efficiency is not the main point, the main point that it will reduce the heat dissipation by half. And therefore, it will allow you to reduce dramatically the size of inverter, while reducing the passive components of magnetic capacitors. It's a long development process. There is nothing that - there is no specific points that are more complex than others. When we develop the technology of HD Wave, we developed in parallel, both topologies, but we have - we have given R\u0026D power. We have a more or less 30% to 50% of all our resources are focused on cost reduction, that's how we can improve our gross margin quarter-over-quarter. And with the rest of the R\u0026D team, we have to prioritize development, and we prioritize the One Phase over the Three Phase. So that's only reason why the Three Phase will come next year where the One Phase face came a year ago.\nJoseph Osha: Okay, And then just a follow-up on the many, many margin question. Let's say hypothetically that you do end up with this 37% and you Ronen are looking at it and saying gosh, this is high, relative to history. At that point do you start giving any additional margin back as price?\nRonen Faier: I think we'll just enjoy the cost reduction to increase market share. We always can reduce price, increase market share or increase price and take smaller market share. I think that it's around 37%, it's better to increase market share thank to increase gross margin, but that's an opinion like any other opinion.\nJoseph Osha: Absolutely. Thank you very much.\nRonen Faier: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you talk a little bit about the currency impact in gross margins and just kind of give us a sense of how large that was in the quarter?\nRonen Faier: So in general, we cannot give that and give the numbers themselves. I can say that they are not - not all of the growth that you saw this quarter was attributed to this much smaller effect. But in general, when we saw that in the last years because of the shrinking euro towards the U.S. dollar, and we saw the margins also reducing and we suffered a little bit. Now we see a little bit better, I would call it better-than-expected effect. And think that most of the effect of the currency is not actually on the price of the gross margin, it's actually on the financial income because the side effect of having the high AR balances in euros, means actually that when the dollar is de-evaluating against the euro, you see the very high financial income. So maybe, 1 should say, we should add some of the unusually high financial income and put it into the margin in order to really see the effect, but I would say that, it's a positive effect, but not all of the improvement that you saw from the last quarter.\nColin Rusch: Okay. That’s super helpful. Ronen, thank you. And then just in terms of geographic diversity, its nice to see how those end markets, can talk a little bit about your anticipation of mix in the third quarter embedded in your guidance, geographically simply…\nRonen Faier: So first of all, we - the guidance assumes growth seen. I would say, most if not all of the regions in which we are our operating. So as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we believe or and the questionable. We believe that U.S. markets will show a little bit of better growth in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And we do expect at the same time that the summer in Europe is continues to play very nice effect that will allow us to grow. We expect that the ratio will be close to where it is right now. And again, we'll have to see when the quarter ends, but in general, we do not expect major shifts in the U.S. and non-U.S. business. All in all, though, we also see that again, it is not affected in the numbers. But the growth that we see some of the be insurance is also in Japan and India, Australia, those markets does not really affect dramatically, right now, the numbers are also growing in a nice and substantial percentages. But this is coming off a smaller base. So all in all, we will continue to see non-U.S. strong sales over the third quarter. And this is what is also baked into our guidance.\nColin Rusch: Okay, excellent, Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from John Quealy with the Canaccord.\nJohn Quealy: Good afternoon, and evening folks. And congrats again. Just maybe to the balance sheet for a minute. The movement of generated cash into marketable securities in the long-term side. Just talk about your uses for those - for that cash moving forward. Obviously, you talked about deepening the supply chain on some part shortages, et cetera, the R\u0026D push and then also something we haven't talked about it, M\u0026A. So just, if you don't mind, just give us an overview of the why putting the cash there now and how do you feel about deploying it inorganically?\nGuy Sella: Okay. I'll start on the second part of the question. Most of our investment among the center of this in policy are relatively to the short duration. Both given the expected movement in interest rates but also given the fact that we know that, some of the money will have to be liquidated within a reasonable timeframe, if we decide to do any moves such as M\u0026A that you have mentioned or any other act. At the same time, given the interest rate environment that you see today on time deposits, if you don't invested in marketable securities, even for a short duration, you get close to 0% as and given the substantial amount, with sympathetic that's a few more points to the EPS is something that's never harmed anyone. From cash deployment's point of view, nothing really changed dramatically. The first thing is that, as a company, the bigger you are, the more you do to maintain cash to run your working capital. Increased sales mean increased manufacturing, means increase sourcing, means increased sourcing of the component. We are sourcing some of the components for our quartet manufacturers to make sure that we are in control of our supply chain. This is something that also require cash. And we also have cash that is always there to support our warranty obligation. As they – and we’re company that give 25 years warranty, it's not just important to accrue everything and put it in your balance sheet. Having money to actually support this accrual something that we deem to be very important. And the last issue again is the M\u0026A front. We are looking for companies, we believe that once opportunities will come, we should be able to perform and basically acquire a company that could add to the revenues and profitability and as such; I'll leave the cash as it is right now. In general though, we do not see very long-term investments, most of the investments are short-term security.\nJohn Quealy: Okay, thanks and as my follow up, just back to the gross margin question. What types of product vitality, some of the things that we saw at Intersolar, my guess are 24-month type introductions? Can you just comment on the cadence of gross margins and products moving into the sort of '18, '19 timeframe, inherently better margins, et cetera? What sort of product vitality of that boost we saw, how much of that should be in sales and, I don't know, in a year? Thank you, guys.\nRonen Faier: Thank you for the question. So in general, as he said, all alone, we will not see even from - either from your product or existing product, that are enjoying cost reductions, we usually we don't see one step function jump in gross margin. Given the fact that again, sales are so much diverse in products and geographies and in segments that even if you grow, one specific product, it does not affect automatically across the board. And as such, you will see, I would call it more of a linear crawling up gross margin towards the 37%, then jump. The 35%, 37% that you mentioned before is something that we can be achieved within the next few quarters. It is not something that will have to wait, we believe, for 3, 4 years. But at the same time, again, it is something that you'll see more of a steady growth then one jump that will happen immediately.\nOperator: And as there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Guy Sella, for any additional closing remarks.\nGuy Sella: In summary, our second quarter results show continues successful of execution of our business strategy with record revenues and consistent growth and profitability. We are well-positioned to continue to expand our business with new product offering and in new territories. We look forward to continuing this momentum. Thank you for joining us on today's call. All the best.\nOperator: And once again, that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.
MCK~2017~2~290~2978~10/28/2016~-.18832888~-.18333149~-.15194388~-.14464188~-4.6257005~-4.9119358~-5.004828~-4.8473339~1~Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson Corporation Quarterly Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Craig Mercer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nCraig Mercer: Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the McKesson fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings call. I am joined today by John Hammergren, McKesson's Chairman and CEO, and James Beer, McKesson's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John will first provide a business update, and then James will review the financial results for the quarter. After James' comments, we will open the call for your questions. We plan to end the call promptly after one hour, at 6:00 PM Eastern Time. Before we begin, I remind listeners that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of McKesson. In addition to the company's periodic, current and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, please refer to the text of our press release for a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. Please note that on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, John and James will reference adjusted earnings, which excludes four items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments, and LIFO-related adjustments. Finally, I would call your attention to the supplemental slides, which we will reference on today's call, and those can be found on the Investors' page of our website. We believe the supplemental slides, which include non-GAAP measures, will provide useful information for investors with regard to the company's operating performance, and comparability of financial results period-over-period. Please refer to our press release announcing second quarter fiscal 2017 results and the supplemental slides for further information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP performance measures to the GAAP financial results. Thank you. And here's John Hammergren.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today, as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for Fiscal 2017. Let's start with our revised Fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities, and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends, compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions. As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our cost alignment plan that was previously announced in March of 2016. As we built our plan and entered Fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016. First generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, this softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing. While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price, but by service, innovation that helps our customers partner, manage, and run their operations, and manage their capital more effectively, and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. Now, price is always a consideration. We provide our customers with premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive, and across several areas of our U.S. pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured. We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing, and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance, relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time. As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated, based on their historical and our historical experience. What we have seen this year to-date, our fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full-year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningfully below those experienced in Fiscal 2016. Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contracts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated, but generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer, but also by the service requirement at the product level. Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts, and a specific behavior of the manufacturers that are our party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exist. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago, before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels. So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions, relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters. So even relatively small changes in behavior could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by brand and generic inflations. So what does all of this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation, relative to the services and value we deliver, amidst a softer pricing environment. Now, turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share, versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with a larger impact coming from competitive pricing. Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then, we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance. Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations, and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market. Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores. We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful onboarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network, another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies. Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the UK government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the UK's decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we've made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate. In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets. As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2. Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team, even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare, while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives. In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses. Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full-year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforce my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity and, clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future. We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well-positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to James and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?\nJames A. Beer: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Today I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions. Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the cost alignment plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior-year gains on the sales of two businesses. To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also, in the second quarter, we recorded pre-tax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the cost alignment plan. Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the cost alignment plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these two headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the two impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items including savings from ongoing cost management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment. A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook. We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost alignment charges, to be approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points. We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter to quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share. As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our cost alignment plan and additional ongoing cost management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth. And I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the cost alignment plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal 2017, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all four elements of our portfolio approach. Now, let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items was $3.17. Now, I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit excluding unusual items was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our cost alignment plan as well as ongoing cost management efforts. Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter. Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge was 25.4%, driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS excluding unusual items of $2.94 decreased 7% versus the prior year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant currency basis, up 12% driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements. Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business, revenues were up 4% for the quarter driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments. Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost reduction actions. Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant currency basis driven by the same factors as previously discussed. Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit excluding unusual items was down 7% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year driven by our cost reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin excluding unusual items of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses. I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased two days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased six days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale, and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals. We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore. In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the board of directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program. Now, moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed, and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pre-tax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant one-time gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo. Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%, thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year, after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings. Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million, after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first-year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed-upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner. In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business. Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I ask that you limit yourself to just one question and a brief follow-up to allow others an opportunity to participate. Noah?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nRoss Muken: Good afternoon. So, John, having been covering this company a long time, I can't recall the last time we had a discussion on competitive pricing. And so, I guess what do you think caused that part of the environment to change over the last three or six months? And obviously, the magnitude that you've given is quite large, and so it's a fairly substantial change. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of different constituents talk about drug pricing and all sorts of other things, but this seems actually unrelated. And so help us just understand, one, what you think caused this, how you think the industry will then respond and hopefully heal. And then, secondarily, on your end, I guess how we should put this into context of what has happened historically, if there's anything that you would compare this to.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Let me start with that, Ross. I have seen this, obviously, throughout my career. But we also saw it at McKesson that where, in particular, we took a step function down with pricing. You may recall, I think in the early part of 2008, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we are facing now. It happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then. And that gave us a stream of profitability that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. You'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time. And from time to time, those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We covered through those periods of time. And like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway.\nRoss Muken: That was helpful. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge R. Hill: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And John, you may have just spoken to it because you called out the pricing pressure, and I wanted to see if you could comment on which market sub-segments are you seeing the pricing pressure the most. It seems like you spoke to independents, but also is it in the independents and the franchisees and the big boxes? I guess any more color on the pricing pressure would be helpful.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Well, thanks for the question, George. I think the most acute area right now is in our independent segment. And clearly, that's a place where you have lots of customers that had long-term relationships, but they also can be fluid. And I think what we've tried to say today is that we plan to maintain our share positions and to grow our business on the value we deliver. And that's really what we're after. The rest of our segments are always competitive, but this is the most material impact we've seen in some time.\nGeorge R. Hill: Okay. And then just my only follow-up would be from a quantification perspective. You gave us the basis point impact. But is there a way to think about the magnitude of the pricing change in that segment that you're seeing? Quantify that. I'm sorry.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Yeah, I think James talked a little bit about the reduction in our expectations and how that split with a larger portion really coming from the price pressure we feel. And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude. And clearly, the independent segment for us is a very valuable and important franchise and we have a lot of business there. So I think that between those comments, you should really get a sense directionally for the size of the challenge.\nGeorge R. Hill: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa C. Gill: Thanks very much. John, just looking at the industry, my understanding was always that a bigger component of your margin actually came from the manufacturers versus the customer relationships. So can you talk about what's happening on that side of your business? And our understanding has been that inventory management agreements cover 80% or 85%. What are you seeing in that other 15% to 20%? Is that having a direct correlation on what you're seeing as far as the reduction in earnings as well?\nJohn H. Hammergren: Right. There really are two factors, and I'll have James talk a little bit about the manufacturers in a minute. Because that obviously, when we talk about brand price inflation trends and we tried to quantify once again in our prepared comments how much of this challenge we had this quarter and the forecast for year is coming from that component, we do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, the manufacturers that play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value and we plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant I think to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. And albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business. That generic business is a source of profitability, and there is obviously flexibility in how we price those generics. And there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics. James, maybe you can talk a little bit about the manufacturer side.\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. In terms of when we came into the year, we were assuming that the level of brand manufacturer or pricing inflation would be modestly below what we had seen in the previous fiscal year. And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a third reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now, a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80%, 20% type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. In part, the contracts have evolved. But also in part as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I peg that split more at 90%, 10%. 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points is still being able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today.\nLisa C. Gill: James, can you help us understand what the actual rate of inflation was last year, when you say you expected it to be down, but now it's meaningfully down? Is there a number you can put around that?\nJames A. Beer: I wouldn't throw out a specific number, but that's why I articulate, the decline that we have seen in the inflation rate is greater than a third of the original expectation for the year. So it's a significant decline.\nLisa C. Gill: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJohn H. Hammergren: I think, Lisa, also, when we look at what we come up with from a calculation perspective on branded inflation, it's plus or minus what you'll see from published sources of inflation. But it is also important to point out that those averages sometimes don't necessarily tell the whole story, because of the mix, or the relationship, or the individual products that are going up or going down in the portfolios can be materially different. And so I do think the economics aren't always necessarily driven with the direct correlation to the average price increases that everybody talks about.\nLisa C. Gill: Okay. Thanks.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.\nMichael Cherny: Good afternoon, guys. I'm going to take this in a little bit of a different direction. I just want to clarify relative to the Change Healthcare deal. James, if you don't mind going back over it, so you said, I believe, $1.10 to $1.30 of dilution from the deal, offset by some other estimate. So is that $1.10 or $1.30 a net dilution deal number to the entire business, or is that offset by those benefits, in which case we're on our own to make the assumptions on that front?\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. So you should think of the $1.10 to $1.30 as the combined effect of the two items that I discussed. The impact of the deferred revenue and then the impact of the higher interest expense on $6.1 billion worth of debt. So wanted to put quantification around those two items. Then, the other comment I made was getting at the reality that as we're actually operating the business and starting to drive the synergies, the EPS that will drive from the contributed assets, if you will, our share of NewCo will be greater than the ability of those assets, absent our deal with Change Healthcare, to drive EPS. So there's an accretive effect, if you will, on that element of the equation. As you would expect, when we come together and drive synergies in a deal. But there are also going to be these two large, very distinct items that will drive dilution, the interest expense and the deferred revenue, haircut you could call it, and that those two items total to this $1.10 to $1.30 range that I mentioned.\nMichael Cherny: Thank you. I know this is a complicated transaction. I appreciate the color. I'll let other people ask some other questions.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) I guess to that, James, do you have any growth forecasts for each of the businesses, EIS and the others? I don't think I see them anywhere. And just maybe, can you speak to the inventory environment? I know last year you scaled up inventory meaningfully in the third quarter. This year you liquidated some. I mean, does that not account for some of the profit shortfall? I know you say you don't do it, but isn't there some opportunity associated with that practice from a profit standpoint that maybe fell out of the model?\nJames A. Beer: There was nothing unusual in the third quarter. You would very normally have an inventory build as you come into the winter season. So no, I wouldn't point to anything odd around inventory management. Our cash flow was obviously a bright spot in our numbers here, and that was very much a result of ongoing working capital management initiatives, these sorts of things that have been going on at McKesson for years as well as our underlying operating profitability obviously as well. But the working capital initiatives have been important focus for us, and we'll continue to have that. The first part of your question, the technology businesses, I wouldn't get into specific growth rates around EIS or any particular segment of the business. Overall, we feel as though our technology segment is performing very nicely, they're very much where we expected them to be at this point in the year. Even though there, as John mentioned in his remarks, is plenty of work going on around setting up the new company or preparing to set up the new company, so we've been pleased that they've been able to maintain their focus. And so we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses generally. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) And just a clarification. James, you did liquidate inventory in the September quarter of this year that did not scale up. Is it just a combined effect of all the businesses resulted in a modest reduction?\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. What I was observing is, in Q3, you would normally have an inventory buildup as you go into the winter season. So yes, that's right. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) All right. Thank you.\nJames A. Beer: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert P. Jones: Thanks for the questions. Yeah, John, I guess like others I'm surprised to hear you highlight competitive pricing, just given how rational the industry has been for so long. And I guess if I take a step back, this year alone, we've seen the negative impact to profitability from generic pricing, moderating. Now, we're talking about a slowdown in branded inflation. Is there any thought that those dynamics themselves are what are forcing your competitors to maybe go harder after market share to make up for what seemingly would have created a shortfall in profit? And then, I guess more importantly, how sustained do you think this competitive behavior could be? Do you think this is more of a one-off, a few accounts that they went after harder, or do you think this could potentially be a more lasting changing dynamic?\nJohn H. Hammergren: I think those are all good questions. I think that the best way for me to answer them would be the way we think at McKesson. I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when – we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things happen, with some of the profit pools become more difficult. What typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. My best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us, and in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success. And that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful, because customers don't want a change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, hey, listen, can you match this deal because I'd like to stay with you. And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions.\nRobert P. Jones: Understood. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen \u0026 Co.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious, James or John, when we think about the reduction in guidance for the year, can you give us a split, maybe, between how much you think is coming from the customer side, versus how much is from the brand inflation side? Is it half and half or...?\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. So a couple of points. In terms of the negative effects, I would say it's the competitive pricing having a greater impact than the brand manufacturer price inflation rate. But also, remember that we offered $1.60 to $1.90 range for those two items. We're bringing the overall company range down by less than that because we've got tailwinds in our view around our tax rate, around our share count, around our interest expense and so forth. So that's going to drive the delta between the two ranges that we're offering today.\nCharles Rhyee: And then to just follow up on the brand inflation side. Obviously, I think most people coming in would have thought, hey, the elections are a factor driving this. How are you guys thinking about it as we move into next year post-elections? Obviously, a lot of spotlight on Congress right now on this topic. How are you at this point thinking about – do you think it bounces back, or do you think this is maybe the new normal and we have to wait for the anniversary? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Well, I think the view we have is sort of a year-to-date view. We have the same information that you have and probably the same visibility. And we're just guessing as to what manufacturers are likely to do going forward like everybody else. They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything, other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior, obviously, has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of – at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R\u0026D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that you'd still see inflation at some levels. I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But, yeah, it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be.\nCharles Rhyee: Thanks. Is it possible to renegotiate these contracts on the fly, or is it you have to wait as the terms come up? And I'll stop there. Thanks.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Well, I think anything is possible. We typically have renegotiated the contracts when they come up as opposed to whenever we're under significant pressure. I think that we always have the opportunity to go back to manufacturers and demonstrate once again the value that we deliver. And in particular, where manufacturer's behavior has changed dramatically from its previous behavior and we had come to depend on those mechanisms as part of our funding source with that manufacturer, I think we have every right to go back to those manufacturers and say, listen, we need to open the dialog again because by your unilateral decision, you have significantly impacted our profitability on your particular product lines and we don't think that's fair and we want to recover that lost margin. So I think that that certainly is something we plan to pursue.\nCharles Rhyee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky R. Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So a few questions here. First of all, just to clarify, John, when you talk about inflation being meaningfully lower, I hear you saying that year-to-date you're seeing greater than a third reduction. And I think going back to past comments, I think you saw 12% last year for your fiscal year. We're getting to around fiscal year 7% year-to-date. But when you think about the December quarter and the March quarter, which usually has a lot of inflation, in your assumption are you assuming that the second half you're going to see that same reduction that you've seen year-to-date? Or are you assuming some acceleration in that given that all the commentary we're hearing about the industry trying to self-regulate? I'm just trying to better understand are you clearing the decks here with this $1.60 to $1.90? Or could there be potentially more downside if in the second half of your fiscal year brand inflation decelerates even more?\nJohn H. Hammergren: James, why don't you...\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. Ricky, to answer your question very directly, what we've assumed for the back half of fiscal 2017 is a continuation of the inflation rate that we have experienced year-to-date.\nRicky R. Goldwasser: Okay. So basically the same type of price increases that we've seen year-to-date to continue for the next couple of quarters.\nJames A. Beer: Yes.\nRicky R. Goldwasser: Okay. And then when we think about the sell side pressure that you're talking about, is that a number that we can take and annualize into next year? And I think my point being is that, obviously, it's a (57:26) and when we think about the margin implication. Is it fair to assume that you just repriced that portion of the contracts that are perennial for this year, or have you also gone proactively to your customers and locked in contracts that are going to come up in the next year or two at a new pricing level?\nJohn H. Hammergren: Well, I think those are, obviously, both good questions. I think to the point that James is making when he answered it a moment ago, we typically see stronger price inflation as you get into our third and fourth quarters. And so when we say we're guiding on a year-to-date basis, that already tells you that we believe there'll be some moderation in those quarters relative to previous behaviors. On the sell side, it's a little bit more difficult to make projections because we're basically in a position where we are reacting to some extent and not being the people that are making the decision. I think that our view is that we have made a very significant change in our pricing practice to match where the market is today. And we, like I said to answer another question that was asked, we have seen this kind of event happen in the past as well and we didn't see a continuation of the event. And our objective is to continue to maintain our market share. So I think we believe we provided guidance that has reasonable expectations from that perspective and that you can count on the range. That's one of the reasons that the range is somewhat wider, though, is it's somewhat dependent on what happens going forward.\nRicky R. Goldwasser: So I think that one of the things that we are all trying to get a better sense of is when we think about fiscal year 2018 and I fully understand that you're not guiding to 2018 and there are a lot of moving parts, but is it reasonable for us to take that $1.60 to $1.90 in EPS impact that we're going to see in the second half of the year and just use it as a run rate for fiscal year 2018 just for these two components?\nJames A. Beer: Well, at this very early stage, Ricky, it's really I don't think it's appropriate for us to try to make any predictions about FY 2018. So I think really we should leave that for closer to the start of that fiscal year. And we'll, obviously, be getting into our guidance process as normal.\nRicky R. Goldwasser: I'm just assuming all steady state, right? So if you're seeing the step-down in your sell side margin, traffic to the EPS impact is going to just slow through...\nJames A. Beer: Yeah. No, I...\nRicky R. Goldwasser: I guess that's the question right now.\nJames A. Beer: I understand the logic. It's just hard for me to take a position on FY 2018 at this very early stage.\nJohn H. Hammergren: Yeah, I think it's a difficult question to answer. But I think – I did try to at least bound the conversation around customer pricing, in that this is a pretty significant step-down, and we believe that that allowed us to maintain the relationships with our customers, given what was a pricing environment where we were higher-priced than where we needed to be, and that has occurred, and it's baked into the guidance that we have provided you, in terms of the range that we just refreshed. Now, I think to James' point, it's pretty early to speculate on what branded inflation might be next year, and what else might happen with our customer base. But we tried to give you as much visibility as we possibly can. I know you guys are on a short timeframe. Let me close this call, if I can, and let you know that – I know you share with us the disappointment in today's news. This is not what we had expected, and certainly not what we want. But despite this downward revision to our outlook, we do believe in and remain committed to the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and our manufacturing partners. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we believe the increased competitive pricing activity does not build sustainable customer relationships or long-term shareholder value, and we are all about sustainable relationships, and creating long-term shareholder value. And we're supported by McKesson's great tradition of customer focus, operational excellence and disciplined execution. And our talented workforce, robust cash flow generation, and strong balance sheet position us for the long-term value creation that we strive to obtain. We remain as committed as ever to our value proposition. And I'll now hand the call off to Craig for his review of upcoming events for the financial community. Craig?\nCraig Mercer: Thank you, John. I have a preview of upcoming events for the financial community. On November 8, we will present at the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. On January 10, we will present at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California. We will release third quarter earnings results in late January. Thank you, and good-bye.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.
ENPH~2017~3~159~1413~11/8/2017~.32276651~.58398139~.87653553~.86461693~-3.9162469~-2.902369~-3.0146646~-3.2041678~1~Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Enphase Energy's Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms. Christina Carrabino. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nChristina Carrabino: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Enphase Energy's third quarter of 2017 results. On today's call are Badri Kothandaraman, Enphase President and Chief Executive Officer; Bert Garcia, Chief Financial Officer; and Raghu Belur, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer. After the market closed today, Enphase issued a press release announcing the results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2017. During the course of this conference call, Enphase management will make forward looking statements including but not limited to statements related to Enphase Energy's financial performance, market demand for its current and future products, advantages of its technology and market trends. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and Enphase Energy's actual results and the timing of event could differ materially from these expectations. For a more complete discussion of the risk and uncertainties, please see the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the SEC, and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 which will be filed with the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2017. Enphase Energy cautions you not to place any undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in its expectations. Also, please note that certain financial measures used on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. The Company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in its earnings release posted today, which can also be found in the Investor Relations section of its website. Now, I'd like to introduce Badri Kothandaraman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enphase Energy. Badri?\nBadri Kothandaraman -: Good afternoon and thanks you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2017 financial results. So, we had a good quarter. Our 30, 20, 10 transformation is going very well. We were almost breakeven in non-GAAP operating income during the third quarter and we have stabilized our cash position. We reported revenue of $77 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2017. We shipped approximately 231 megawatts or 790,000 microinverters. Our GAAP gross margin was 21.4% and non-GAAP gross margin was 21.8%. Our focus on operational excellence resulted in gross margin expansion, lower OpEx and overall improvement to our financial position in the third quarter. We're laser focused on further gross margin improvement through supply chain optimization, new product introduction and pricing management and are on track to reach our 30, 20, 10 target operating model by the fourth quarter of 2018. Bert will go into greater detail about our financial results later in the call. So, turning to our market. The third quarter revenue in the U.S. was up 2% sequentially. We completed the transition to IQ 6 product for our U.S. and Latin American customers during the quarter and nearly all fourth quarter inverter shipments to these regions will be the IQ 6 products. Shipments for AC module product also increased sequentially. In the Latin American market, the third quarter revenue was down 9% sequentially as a result of the devastating hurricane in Puerto Rico at the end of the quarter, which impacted overall shipments to the region. We look forward to playing a key role in the future as the island rebuilds and diversifies its electrical infrastructure. Raghu, our Chief Product Officer will provide details later in the call on a key technology that will be central to this effort. In the APAC region, the revenue increased 35% sequentially as the demand for our products continued to grow. We established new partnerships with distributors, installers and module manufacturers in India during the quarter resulting in our first shipments to the region. In Europe, revenue was up 3% sequentially and 114% year-over-year. The third quarter was a record quarter for unit shipments and revenue in the region as we continue to grow our customer base. Moving on to products, we believe the IQ 6 microinverter system and our AC modules will help drive profitable growth with new and existing partners, thus increasing our share of market. We remain focused on operational blocking and tackling to achieve this goal. With the introduction of what IQ 7 product in the first quarter of 2018, we expect to grow revenue by increasing out served available market. IQ 7 will be a single world-wide product skew that allows us to penetrate new markets in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, while also helping to drive gross margin expansion. In summary, we are pleased with our overall progress during the past three months. My top priorities over the next six months are to improve cash flow, further expand gross margin with the introduction of IQ 7 worldwide and achieve sustained profitability, creating a solid financial foundation. We will also continue to provide customers with the value, quality and customer service they’ve come to expect from Enphase. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Raghu, our Chief Product Officer to provide an expanded update on our products.\nRaghu Belur: Thanks, Badri. As part of our commitment to deliver increased value to our customers, we transitioned over the past few quarters from our M-series to our IQ series product. IQ is an integrated solar, storage and energy management platform that enables self-consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation and improving system availability uptime and reliability. In addition, IQ provides advanced grid functions that are capable of meeting worldwide regulatory requirements. IQ also enables our AC module product further simplifying the installation process, reducing installation time and streamlining logistics. IQ 6 delivers more power and higher efficiency, while further reducing the balance of system cost due to its simplified wiring, reduced size and weight. Much of IQ 6 performance was achieved by silicon integration with our new ASIC. With IQ 7 we will yet again offer greater power and a smaller, lighter and easier to install product. What is unique about our IQ 7 is that it's a single worldwide skew, achieved as a result of our software defined architecture. Similar to IQ 6, we have developed a new ASIC for IQ 7 that enables greater semiconductor integration. Solar plus storage, which includes our AC battery product is central to our product strategy. Our storage business continues to expand worldwide because of the unique features of our AC battery solution. We believe the storage market will continue to improve over the next 12 months as cost come down and as utilities better understand how to incorporate distributed storage on to the grid. Now let me talk about our next generation IQ 8 product expected to be introduced in 2019 based on our always on technology called Ensemble. One of solar's biggest challenges is that it is grid tied. What this means is that if the grid fails and the sun is still shining, there will be no production out of your solar system. Most customers are unaware of this limitation with today's solar technology. So, to address this limitation we have invented a microinverter technology that is completely grid agnostic. This means that even if the grid fails and there is sufficient sunlight, the Enphase system will continue to produce energy and meet the demands of the home or business. The Enphase microinverter system's capabilities further enhanced when the Ensemble technology is incorporated into our AC battery storage solution. With IQ 8 you can have a system that will continuously produce energy, regardless of the presence or absence of the grid that is storage during the day -- sorry, solar during the day and storage at night. That is what we mean by always on and it can address challenges like those experienced in Puerto Rico, other island nations and countries with weak grids. We also believe IQ 8 will grow our total addressable market worldwide. For example, there are over 1.2 billion people with limited or no access to energy in regions such as India and Africa. IQ 8 is uniquely positioned to address the energy challenges inherent in these and other regions of the world. We'll continue to update you on IQ 8's progress over the coming quarters. Now I'll turn the call over to Bert for his review of our financial results.\nBert Garcia: Thanks Raghu. I'll provide more details related to our third quarter 2017 financial results as well as our business outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the financial measures that I am going to provide are on a non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2017 was $77 million, an increase of 3% sequentially. Total net revenue per DC watt was unchanged from the prior quarter, reflecting relatively stable ASP's. On a year-over-year basis, total net revenue for DC watt decreased by 11%, directionally consistent with the broad reduction in ASP's. We shipped approximately 231 megawatts DC in the third quarter 2017, an increase in megawatt of 3% sequentially and a decrease in megawatts of 3% on a year-over-year basis. The megawatt shipped represented 790,000 microinverters, approximately 6% of which were our new IQ microinverter system. As Badri mentioned, we completed the transition to IQ 6 product for our U.S. and Latin American customers during the third quarter and as a result nearly all fourth quarter shipments to these regions will be our IQ 6 product. Non-inverter revenue which includes our 18-battery storage solution, Envoy Communications Gateway and all accessories, was consistent as a percent of revenue with our prior quarter results. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2017 was 21.8% compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $347,000 of stock-based compensation. The improved gross margin reflects the transition to our IQ microinverter system in North America as well as the improvements to-date that we have implemented on our supply chain optimization initiatives. The improvement to our gross margin was slightly offset by approximately negative 1.8% related to expert IPs that we incurred as a result of industry-wide component shortages mentioned on our Q2 call. Non-GAAP operating expense decreased $865,000 sequentially from $17.8 million in Q2 to $16.9 million in Q3. As compared to the year ago quarter, we reduced non-GAAP operating expense by 41% or $11.7 million, reflecting the cumulative impact of restructuring actions and operational efficiencies we've implement. Non-GAAP operating expense in the third quarter of 2017 excludes $4.1 million of restructuring charges and $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense. On a non-GAAP basis, income from operations was essentially breakeven with a loss of $102,000 compared to an operating loss of $4 million in Q2. We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made on operating income and have increased confidence in our ability to achieve non-GAAP operating profitability in the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP net loss was $964,000 resulting in a loss of $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $6.6 million in Q2 or a loss of $0.08 per share now. Now turning to the balance sheet, inventory levels were $25.3 million for the third quarter compared to $20.8 million in the second quarter and $39.1 million in the year ago quarter. Inventory levels increased from the second quarter, primarily a result of the timing of shipments. We exited the quarter with a total cash balance of $28.9 million, a slight decrease from the Q2 balance. We expect to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter. Now let's look at our outlook for the fourth quarter 2017. We expect our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 built in a range of $72 million to $80 million. Turning to margins, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 21.5% to 24.5%. Note that our Q4 gross margin guidance includes the negative impact of higher expedited fees resulting from industry-wide component shortages. Non-GAAP gross margin excludes approximately $300,000 of stock-based compensation expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense for the fourth quarter to be within a range of $19.5 million to $21.5 million and non-GAAP operating expense to be within a range of $16 million to $18 million excluding an estimated $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and approximately $2.1 million of additional restructuring expense. I'll note that we do not expect to incur significant restructuring expense beyond the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP operating income basis in Q4. With that, I'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig Hallum. Your line is now open.\nEric Stine: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question or the questions. Maybe just starting with the AC modules, maybe just some commentary on early returns and are you still targeting an additional module partner by the end of the year?\nBadri Kothandaraman: So, let me give you some color on AC module. This is Badri. We started shipping AC modules to LG in the second quarter of 2017. We said in the June Analyst Day Presentation, that we shipped about 18,000 units to LG. Our shipment increased sequentially in Q3 of '17. LG if you know introduced the IQ 6+ neon AC module in July. That product is making its way through the channels now. It's too early to say but we've done a lot of interviews with the installers and those interviews have been -- those interviews have been very encouraging. There is clear savings on installation time as well as streamlined logistics on the ACM. We announced the Jinko Eagle in IQ 6 AC module at SBI and we expect to start shipping that shortly. We also announced Waaree, a module partner in India. We are working with a few other partners as well and will announce when we're ready.\nEric Stine: Okay. Sticking with India with Waaree, is that a little bit different version of what you're able to talk about? Is that a little different version or scaled-down version versus LG or Jinko and if so, is that something that you're working to replicate with other partners in different markets?\nBadri Kothandaraman: No, it's not a scale down or a different version. We have a AC module product strategy and it is in line with all the other partners as well, the only difference being LG would be -- is a 60-cell module and Waaree will be a 72-cell module because in India primary the market segment is 72. What's really good is that the IQ 6 Plus blood and the IQ 7 Plus product works on the same product works on both 60 cell and 72 cell module.\nEric Stine: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that color. Maybe last question for me. Just an update on installer trends, you mentioned the good feedback you're getting early with LG, but clearly things moving to Tier 2 and Tier 3 installers. So just any thoughts or color there would be helpful, thanks a lot.\nBadri Kothandaraman: Yeah, we're continuing to reach out to all the installers who have either done the installs as well as we are on roadshows collecting data and the feedback has been pretty consistent. The value is there, the installed time value, logistics value, the good matching between the power production because of the inverter and the module being closely matched. And then quantitatively speaking, good quality installed as well because it's a very fast and very clean install. So, lot of outreach is going on. We're on the road right now showing it to all number of the longtail installers as well. So, the feedback has been good.\nEric Stine: And just market share there, just overall share with Tier 2 and Tier 3. Any thoughts on how that's trended. I know you gave an update at the Analyst Day but maybe anything that might be refresh over the last couple months?\nBadri Kothandaraman: No, it's too early to tell at this time.\nEric Stine: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Brad Meikle with Coker Palmer. Your line is now open.\nBrad Meikle: Hey guys. Good afternoon. First question is do you think that the revenues you were able to achieve this quarter were limited by the 201-case impact, which has increased module prices and made them more scarce in some cases and also due to the component shortages that you have?\nRaghu Belur: So, hey Brad. No, I think there's been a lot of concern around the 201 case and as I think everybody saw, the preliminary recommendation that were made were certainly looking punitive than everybody was expecting, but that's good news. That said, looking at third quarter, we really didn't see any impact related to 201 in terms of revenue shipments. Although the second part of your question was income shortages.\nBrad Meikle: If revenue is limited, we're limited by component availability.\nBadri Kothandaraman: So, Brad, the revenue was not limited by component shortages, but what we -- but the gross margin was limited. As we noted, the Q3 gross margin was negatively impacted by about 1.8% resulting from expedite fees and those expedite fees were a result of us having to air ships compared to ocean ships. And in Q4 '17 we still see continued present on memories and high-voltage feds and that's why we said, we expect to incur expedite fees in Q4 '17 as well. We are putting in some business processes in place like qualifying multiple sources as mitigation actions, but we really need the supply situation to improve and at this point, we see the situation persisting into the first half of 2018.\nBrad Meikle: Yeah, it sounds like lead times have come down already for the feds, but on IQ 7, is there a -- what portion of the market would you say is a high-voltage modules that had not really been suitably served by your power rating on the M280 or the IQ 6, like how much more market does it open up to you?\nRaghu Belur: Sure hey, thanks Brad, this is Raghu. One of the nice things about again the IQ 7 being a universal black farm house, like a worldwide skew is that it does open up the market for the 96-cell module as well. So, in that there are a couple of players who are doing 96-cell modules as well. So, Panasonic is now entered the market with a 96-cell product. We already know there's another player here lately who is also a 96-cell product, but the IQ 7 does open up those markets for us as well from a technology point of view.\nBrad Meikle: Yeah, yeah, I think it's about a quarter of a third of U.S. residential market probably is that right?\nRaghu Belur: Yeah probably upside order or little bit less actually.\nBrad Meikle: Okay. And this is last question, thanks for the time, on the IQ 8 could you talk a little bit more about the types of companies that are currently serving this market? I've read about half-dozen that are well-capitalized in Africa doing small 1-10 installations that enable light and some articles have talked about a AC output enabling air-conditioning and refrigeration, which is limited by the current DC output. So, I would love to hear any more about the dynamics of what you see out there in that market?\nRaghu Belur: I think it's Africa and there is also India as well. I think there are number of players. Go to market is the problem that needs to be solved there. I think we have solved the technology problem. So clearly there are -- we were seeing that both in India and Africa and in India, there are a number of companies that are working on the go-to-market problem and have had varying degrees of success there. So yes, that are a number of companies that are out there. They're not making any announcements at this time.\nBrad Meikle: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is now open.\nPhilip Shen: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. First one here is on the IQ 7. I think in your release, you talk about getting that out there in Q1 '18 so what do you expect the mix of IQ 6 and IQ 7 to be starting Q1 '18 and how do you expect that mix to trend as we go through 2018?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Just to give you some color on IQ 6, the IQ 6 transition took us three quarters to complete. We expect the IQ 7 transition to take a similar time, may be a little bit lesser. A new product transition as you know is always tough to predict, but we're doing a lot of detailed planning to counter surprises. Having said that the IQ 6 the IQ 7 uses the same balanced system as IQ 6. So that will make it a little bit easier. And also, one more thing is the transitioning for example IQ 7 to North American customers is going to be easier than transitioning wildlife. So, I expect that to be done faster maybe in a couple of quarters compared to world-wide. That might take full three quarters timeframe. So more to come there, but we are planning -- we're doing a lot detailed planning.\nPhilip Shen: Good. Thanks, Badri and if you can remind us or update us on what kind of margin benefits we should see as you fully transition from IQ 6 to IQ 7?\nBadri Kothandaraman: So, as I told you we're focused on building a healthy financial foundation and we are laser focused on gross margin and operational excellence leading to profitability. We told you that we will reach the 30, 20, 10 target operating margin by Q4 of '18 and we are on track to do so. The 30, 20, 10 stands for 30% gross margin, 20% OpEx and 10% operating income. The IQ 7 transition will not only help in improving gross margin, but will also help to expand the served available market into more regions in Europe and Asia Pacific to increase the top line and we also see the ACM as an important driver of the IQ 7 platform. So, with the IQ 7 with all the supply chain optimizations that we are doing, we expect to reach our target operating model by the timeframe that we said, which is Q4 of '18.\nPhilip Shen: Okay. Great. So, moving the question to the top line that I think you blended ASP decline in the quarter was roughly 12% year-on-year, do you continue to expect that rate of decline. I think that was for Q3. So, do you continue to expect that for Q4 and what are you seeing now for Q1 and what do you expect for 2018?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Well for 2018 we have a number of factors I'll come to that later, but for Q4 I see the pricing pretty stable at about 2% erosion a quarter. So, in 2018 I have a couple of factors which could contribute to the pricing environment. One is an [Sunny] case. We all don't know what the final outcome is going to be in January. So that could influence that. And the second one is a potential Huawei entry in the middle of 2018. If I pretend that those two were not there, I expect a pretty stable pricing environment, similar to 2017.\nPhilip Shen: Okay. Good. And finally, as it relates to your non-GAAP profitability, it sounds you are in check for Q4, I know you haven’t provided guidance for '18, but do all signs give you a sense that you can maintain that for '18 and what are the puts and takes maybe just mentioned a couple with the 201 and Huawei, but how are you thinking about profitability as we go through '18?\nBert Garcia: Hey Phil, it's Bert. You're right that we did signal non-GAAP profitability to the midpoint of the range for the fourth quarter. If we transition out into 2018, you're right, we don't provide guidance out that far, but clearly the work we've done to date to restructure is begin to yield significant benefits for us. And if we think about the transition to IQ 7 that's certainly going to continue to help, not only margin expansion but also help grow the topline. As Badri mentioned, the IQ 7 does open up a couple of new markets that's certainly helpful, but bear in mind, a lot of the work we've done around restructuring even here in the tail end of 2017 will continue to bear fruit out in 2018. It's more of a process non-event so to speak. So, we do expect to continue to see benefit from our broad supply chain optimization and our focus and operational excellence also continue to help move margins and profitability along in 2018.\nPhilip Shen: Great. Thanks Bert. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham \u0026 Company. Your line is now open.\nEdwin Mok: Great. Thanks for taking my question. First just in terms of 4Q guidance, can you talk a little about your puts and takes on that? It seems like your guidance is flattish right and mostly just seasonality in the fourth quarter or do you see the margin recovering after this 201 is settled, do you have any color on that?\nBadri Kothandaraman: So, I think what you're seeing in our guidance really is us holding share. So, we're thinking about it, but more importantly what you're seeing at one is some pricing discipline. We're being very, very, very disciplined on pricing, optimizing for profitable to well and that is of course reflected in our topline guidance. In terms of puts and takes again as I mentioned to Brad, I am not seeing any impact from them on our topline that's not really factoring our guidance. So, it really is a factor of us holding share and being disciplined on pricing.\nEdwin Mok: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe talk a little about gross margin, given that you have this excess could happen because of the shortage right, how much impact have you factored out into your gross margin guidance and do you any kind of view when we should start to have this stabilize and you can stop being risky?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Yes, so just to level set anything you back in Q3 was about 1.8% impact negative on Q3. We had somewhere between 1% and 2% in Q4 and then expect to start seeing it tailing off into 2018. So, it's a little early in these things. It's not entirely within our control, but our guess right now is that we'll start to see a tailing off of that impact in Q1.\nEdwin Mok: Okay. That's helpful. I guess I'll stick with you Badri. I saw on the balance sheet of fees actually going up and then I think cable has also gone up a lot this quarter. Do you expect those to normalize as you in the fourth quarter or would that take some time?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Yes, we do expect to normalize and they are somewhat related. So, on the receivables line, it was really impacted by the linearity of sales in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's really what drove the increase there. On the AP side it was actually related to inventory. We had some late receipts of inventory in September that's reflected in the increase sequentially in inventory. It's also in our AP. The other thing that in our AP line that's beyond the inventory and its really part of the work that we've been doing on supply chain optimization and working capital management in particular inventory management is working with our vendors to get returns and you see some of that in our AP in Q3, slight improvement in AP terms.\nEdwin Mok: Okay. Great. One last question I had on IQ 7 I think you mentioned 1Q is not launched out and you mentioned it will penetrate some new markets. Is it just software feature that allows you to kind of all this grid in phase for different regions of the world or what allows you to penetrate these new markets and I notice that Japan I mentioned there, where do we stand on Japan?\nRaghu Belur: So yes, this is Raghu. The architecture is such that you know it's a digital architecture, is a piece of power electronics, not a big box power. So, both are on our ASICs. So, it is a completely software defined device that allows us to profile to do configure them based on the geography that you're into meeting the connection requirements and the requirements that's correct. Of course, right now we're focused on IQ 7 is our fan expansion plan and Japan is on the roadmap. We're not exactly talking to today about the timing on that, but it does open up, as I said it's a worldwide skew that is capable of being configured for virtually all the geographies. So, we're going to be attacking more geographies over time.\nEdwin Mok: Do you see IQ 7 accelerate ACM adoption or are those mutual exclusive?\nRaghu Belur: No absolutely, IQ 7 is again it's much smaller, much lower profile. It's actually been designed and architected with the ACM in mind because ACM is absolutely a very key strategy for us. So yes, it does in fact accelerate ACM and accelerate new partners as well.\nEdwin Mok: Great. That's all I have. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nColin Rusch: Bert, can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics on a regional basis, it looks like if you're flat quarter-over-quarter, but with the growth in Asia, is that offsetting some price pressure in other geographies?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Regarding the pricing -- regarding the pricing environment like what I said, we see pricing pretty stable at about 2% erosion quarter-on-quarter. If you ask me what it was for 2017, it was about 7% to 10%.\nColin Rusch: Okay. So, you're seeing a 2% across the Board regardless of regions. Okay. And then with the working capital dynamics, as you guys get into a more robust transposition and operational cash flow, are you seeing opportunities to go back to your suppliers and get better terms and support some of the balance sheet with longer payment terms on the payables line.\nBadri Kothandaraman: Yeah, I just mentioned in the last -- with the last caller that one of the driving AP up a little bit sequentially are the better terms You're hitting something that's really important Colin, which is as our financial performance improves, naturally my cost of capital comes down. I expect to see that reflected in terms only with my vendors, but also with our lender. And we're excited about the opportunity to go back and recast some of those relationships in a more positive way.\nColin Rusch: Okay. And then the last question for me is really about the warranty obligations they haven’t really move much here for a little while and obviously you are growing sales. So, can you talk a little bit about some of the reliability data that you're seeing and how those things are rolling off for you guys in terms of the forward risk sure?\nBadri Kothandaraman: Sure, I can handle both of those areas. I may ask Raghu to weigh a little bit on the reliability piece. So, I would like to take them in reverse order. On the reliability piece, we're seeing tremendous reliability returns from our current product is really, really performing very, very well. So, the reliability is very high and as a result the returns are understandably low. From a warranty perspective, bear in mind, you're right, our install base is growing but we are relieving the warranty liability as we build it. So, what you're seeing is really the netting of those two things over time. So again, as we ship more units into the installed base, the warranty liability will go up as we settle the warranty obligations for a large and growing install base, you will that liability to come down.\nRaghu Belur: And Colin from a product point of view, what's core to our product strategy is semiconductor integration and every generation of product from the M-series to IQ 6 to IQ 7 has been -- we have a new ASIC in there, a new chip in there and what chip does is more and more integration. So, we're in from 1.8 million gauge to 2.8 to 3.8 million gauge now the IQ 7. More integration means just better reliability because you have got fewer and fewer components on it. And internally and all our testing just gets more sophisticated over time, the data that comes back from the field as you know all our systems are connecting. So, we get very high-quality data from the field and our systems are performing. All of that informs the quality and reliability of our product. So, the combination of a semiconductor strategy which is core to Enphase coupled with all of the feedback that we get from the field are you just creates us nice virtuous cycle that's needy of having a digital architecture and power tonics.\nColin Rusch: Great. Thanks, so much guys. I'll hop back in queue.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nPavel Molchanov: Thanks for taking the question guys. Given that Jinko and a few other Chinese companies as your partners do not have manufacturing assets in the U.S. currently. Would anything change in a relationship depending on how the tariff decision ends up coming out?\nBadri Kothandaraman: No. We don't expect any significant change there. Again, with the tariffs concerned it's on the module. We don't know all the details as yet, but our expectation is that it won't change. Second, is we also think about ACM as a worldwide skew. It's one just simply a North America skew alone. And coupled with the fact that IQ7 is a worldwide product and it's going also inure at the ACM and we think that the risk is lower manageable.\nPavel Molchanov: Okay. And there was a comment you guys made earlier about the percentage of non-inverter revenue remaining stable quarter-over-quarter if I heard that correctly. Will that percentage in theory increase over time, particularly as battery sales become more meaningful and should it be increasing?\nBadri Kothandaraman: It's very intuitive. It should, you're right as ACV become a larger and larger part of a portion of our mix it would be an increasing portion of that non-inverter revenue and mix that's right.\nPavel Molchanov: All right. That's for me. I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nVishal Shah: Yeah hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions on the pricing environment and the competitive environment, you mentioned stable pricing in the near-term what are your conversations with the customer suggesting its pricing is going to be in the next quarter or and when kind of seasonality are you seeing in the business. And then you mentioned Huawei is rolling out products in the second half of '18. What's the initial feedback you're hearing from the field on that product from your customers? Thank you.\nBadri Kothandaraman: As I think about the pricing environment, environment has been pretty stable, it's at about 2% erosion per quarter. For the entire year we have been at about 7% to 10%. Coming to 2018 so there are two factors like what I said again. [Sun Eva] as well as potential Huawei entry. In the case of Sun Eva, the final outcome is not yet out. So, after that we'll be able to see what happens. In the case of Huawei, we don't even understand what their product is yet and once that is announced, we can react better. But let me give you some color on our pricing management, the way we think about pricing is by doing value based pricing. What do you mean by value-based pricing. So, we take the next best alternative, which is offered by our competition and then we think about what value does offer compared to the product next best alternative. For example, in ECM it is installation time saving, it is streamlined logistics, it is improved quality, it is enhanced power production. Then we say here is the value you ascribe to that and we tell the customers that look we'll share some of that value with you. So, we do that -- we do this transactional discussion with every one of our customers and this is transactional pricing, which means it's literally hundreds of lines item every quarter and in some cases the customers doesn’t see the value, then we go and look at what we should do on that case, but there are literally a lot of cases like that. It is a process, it's not an event. We're getting better at it and pricing management is key for us to improve our gross margin and to reach our 30, 20, 10 operating model by Q4 of '18.\nVishal Shah: That's helpful. Just a follow-up on the first quarter outlook, have you seen a slowdown as normal seasonality would suggest or do you think the first quarter this year will be next quarter, next year will be different concerning some of the 201 dynamics. So, thank you?\nBert Garcia: So, as you know Vishal we don't guide beyond the current quarter, but there is no reason to believe that normal seasonality patterns are going to hold and are likely not going to be necessarily impacted by it.\nVishal Shah: Thanks Bert. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] I am showing no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Badri Kothandaraman for any closing remarks.\nBadri Kothandaraman: Yeah, thank you for joining us today. We're extremely pleased with our progress in the third quarter towards our 30, 20, 10 target operating model. We look forward to speaking with you again on our call next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may disconnect Everyone, have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Moore. You may begin.\nClaiborne Moore: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor Section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nJames A. Squires: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. It is with great pleasure that I introduce Cindy to our quarterly calls. She brings a strong diverse background to this role. I look forward to her contributions as we continue to execute our strategies centered on safety, service, stewardship and growth. Highlighting our third quarter results on slide 4; net income was $506 million, up 10% from prior year and earnings per share increased 13% to $1.75. Our third quarter operating ratio decreased by 160 basis points to an all-time quarterly record of 65.9%. Our third quarter results are an extension of the performance delivered throughout the year resulting in a record 67.4% operating ratio and record earnings per share of $4.93 for the nine-month period. These results demonstrate the successful execution of our proactive strategies and initiatives. Our continual focus on delivering results through cost saving efforts, efficiencies, and asset utilization have us on track to deliver productivity savings of over $100 million in 2017. The unrelenting focus and resolve of our employees on delivering upon the goals we set out in our strategic plan is evident in our achievements to-date. As shown on slide 5, for seven consecutive quarters, we have lowered the operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. We continue to make demonstrable progress toward achieving a sub-65% operating ratio. Our team remains committed to ongoing productivity initiatives and the pursuit of additional opportunities for improvement. And for these efforts, I am confident that we will reach that goal by 2020 or sooner. We remain focused on both resource utilization and growth, as we continue to successfully execute our multidimensional strategy. Our third quarter volumes increased by 4%, while average head count was reduced by 4% versus last year's levels. We are resolute in our commitment to deliver a quality service product that our customer value and will provide opportunities for growth. Now, Alan will provide a marketing overview, Mike will detail our operational performance and Cindy will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. With that I'll now turn the program over to Alan.\nAlan H. Shaw: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Our third quarter 2017 revenue growth in all three business units reflects the strength and sustainability of our strategic plan. Total revenue for the quarter was up 6% versus 2016 driven by a combination of volume gains in intermodal, coal and steel and increased pricing. Merchandise volume was down slightly in the third quarter as gains in steel, sand and fertilizers were more than offset by lower automotive shipments associated with U.S. vehicle production declines and reduced crude oil shipments. Overall merchandise revenue was up 3% this quarter as negotiated price increases outpaced volume losses. Intermodal revenue increased $46 million, or 8% versus the same period in 2016, resulting from highway conversions, organic growth with our existing customers and new service offerings. Intermodal achieved record volume for the second consecutive quarter as total units once again topped the 1 million unit mark. Our intermodal growth in the third quarter is the result of our market approach, which aligns our service product with the needs of our customers, enhancing their ability to grow while positioning Norfolk Southern as an integral part of their supply chain. Coal posted year-over-year revenue and volume growth primarily due to increased export coal volume and pricing. Coal RPU was up 1% due to the impact of pricing gains that were partially offset by negative mix. Higher growth rates and lower rated export steam negatively impacted RPU despite improved pricing in our export markets. Utility volume decreased as mild weather caused an approximate 15% year-over-year decline in overall coal burn in eastern utilities. Turning to slide 8. We look ahead to the remainder of the year with confidence based on current economic trends. In merchandise, we expect low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Industrial production is likely to drive demand in steel, while growth in construction will positively impact our aggregate volume. Further, we expect increased drilling activity in the Marcellus/Utica region will continue to drive growth in frac sand. These increases will be offset by declines in automotive and by a lower crude oil, which is adversely impacted by pipeline activity. Intermodal expectations remained strong as tight trucking capacity should be further impacted by the ELD implementation in December. We continue to enhance our service offerings, providing growth opportunities with our customers to further drive revenue, volume and shareholder value. In coal, we expect fourth quarter utility volume to be in the range of 15 million to 17 million tons impacted by the mild summer weather. Export tonnage should continue to exceed last year's with volume in the range of 5 million to 6 million tons. We remain focused on pricing in all of our markets. Current indicators point to higher levels of demand and tighter truck capacity for the remainder of the year continuing into 2018. Such an environment increases our value in the marketplace, and we are confident that improvement will be reflected in our pricing. Moving to slide 9. Our market approach and current opportunities are consistent with our strategic plan, offering a balance of safety, service, productivity, and growth to drive shareholder value. To execute this plan, we deliver customer-centric service product that adapts to the needs of our customers, while providing an environment, in which, it is easy to do business. Our customer-centric service product first focuses on tailoring the right service to our customers. We collaborate with our customers to develop the best product that is beneficial to both our shareholders and customers. We pay close attention to customer feedback and continue to make adjustments to meet their needs, viewing our product through the lens of our customers. Our goal is to enhance the competitiveness of our customers in an evolving marketplace, allowing them to quickly adapt and compete for growth, increasing revenue to Norfolk Southern, while strengthening our role in their supply chain. Lastly, we employ best-in-class industrial development team to help customers locate or expand on our lines, providing a future pipeline for growth. The continuity of our management team, operating philosophy, and longstanding customer relationships combined with improving the customer experience and product is the overarching theme of our growth initiatives. We are confident this approach differentiates our service product, allows us to compete with truck, and will continue to provide the revenue and volume growth and shareholder value we delivered this quarter. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to, Mike, for an update on operations.\nMichael J. Wheeler: Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Our service levels are delivering growth consistent with our strategic plan. As shown on slide 11, there were significant milestones achieved in the quarter as well as the first three quarters of the year. Our achievements in reducing train accidents combined with our improvements in train length, locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency all helped to drive a record operating ratio. Turning to the key drivers of our success on slide 12. The safety of our employees in the communities we serve continues to be our top priority. Our reportable and serious injury ratios are stable and we are on pace to achieve our lowest train accident frequency on record. For service, we achieved sequential improvement in our network performance metrics. Specifically, our service composite metric is back near 80%, which points to resiliency in our operation. This is particularly notable given volume was up sequentially, while we also successfully controlled costs. Our current service levels are allowing us to not only take on short-term opportunities, but also positions us to have more impactful discussions with our customers concerning long-term opportunities. Moving to some of our key productivity initiatives on slide 13. We are driving improvement in all areas. Our continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. The third quarter was the highest quarter of locomotive productivity in our company's history and we are on pace to beat last year's record performance. Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost, they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which improved 4% in the quarter and was an all-time quarterly record. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure and we are on track to set a new record this year. These measures have been driven by optimizing our train plan and are improvements in train lengths, which is something we must balance with service. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure and we are on track to set a new record for the full year. In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a level of service to our customers that will grow our business while at the same time driving sustainable productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders. We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders. I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover our financial achievements.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone. As Mike and Alan have discussed we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and the operating results from the third quarter show we are; 1) reducing costs; 2) driving productivity; and 3) growing the company. On slide 15, you'll see we delivered a record quarterly operating ratio of 65.9%, a 160 basis point improvement over third quarter 2016. We accomplished this by growing revenues 6% as Alan described, while holding expenses to a 3% increase resulting in an 11% rise in income from railway operations. Now turning to the component changes and operating expenses on slide 16. In total, operating expenses were higher by $55 million or 3%. Notwithstanding the 4% increase in volume, improved productivity helped to offset higher inflation. The area of largest variance in the quarter, Compensation and Benefits rose by $64 million, or 9% year-over-year. There are two primary reasons for the increase. First, improved operating results led to an increase in incentive compensation of $47 million over the third quarter 2016. And second, inflationary increases continue at a quarterly run rate of about $30 million, which is higher than historical inflation. As discussed in previous quarters, the increase is primarily due to the large increase in premiums on union medical plans. Partially offsetting these items were reduced employee levels, which saved $26 million. Headcount was about 1,100 employees lower than the third quarter of 2016 and down over 300 sequentially. Year-over-year, we are handling more shipments with fewer people. We expect to enter 2018 with employment levels flat to slightly higher than where we are now, as we hire and train T\u0026E employees ahead of the 2018 peak demand months in summer and fall. Fuel expense rose $17 million entirely attributable to higher prices which added $20 million. The average price per gallon for locomotive fuel was $1.70 this year versus $1.51 in the third quarter of 2016. Sustained improvements in fuel efficiency resulted in 2% fewer gallons consumed on 4% more volume. As Mike mentioned, we posted record fuel efficiency metrics and we expect our ongoing initiatives to further increase train lengths and reduce fuel consumption to support continued improvement. Purchased Services and Rents decreased $9 million, or 2% year-over-year. Equipment rents decreased by $6 million due to lower automotive traffic and improved equipment utilization. The Materials and Other category decreased $24 million, or 13% year-over-year. Lower equipment and roadway material usage drove over half of the decrease. As we reduced the locomotive fleet in service, locomotive repair costs have decreased. Third quarter 2017 also included $9 million more from gains on the sale of operating properties. Moving to slide 17 which shows the full income statement. You can see the strong operating results fell to the bottom line producing net income of $506 million, up 10% compared with 2016 and diluted earnings per share were $1.75, a 13% improvement. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 18, we continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the first nine months and over $1.2 billion has been returned to shareholders. As we announced last month, the board increased our share repurchase authority by 50 million shares and extended the program through 2022. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrates our continued focus on cost reduction, productivity and growth. Thanks for your attention. And I'll turn the call back to Jim for closing remarks.\nJames A. Squires: Thank you, Cindy. As we head towards the end of 2017, we remain as committed and energized as we were at the onset of our plan to deliver sustainable changes that will improve bottom line results for shareholders. Our plan is dynamic and flexible and provides an adaptive platform that will be the foundation of success for our employees, customers, and shareholders. We have consistently delivered strong performance and we are confident in our ability to achieve further improvements and reach our objectives that will drive shareholder value. With that, we'll now open the line for Q\u0026A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to your view on the tightness in the truck market and how you think that could help results in 2018 from both a volume perspective and a price perspective. And then sort of along the same lines, in terms of potential share gains from CSX, could you elaborate or provide some color on what you think you received from them and how much you would expect to keep or give back? Thanks.\nJames A. Squires: Well, let's take the truck capacity question first. It certainly is an encouraging environment. We are seeing truck capacity tight and getting tighter. Alan, why don't you provide some specifics?\nAlan H. Shaw: Yeah. Allison, as you know, we've clearly stated that our primary form of competition is truck. And within the East, we have a unique opportunity to divert shipments away from the highway to rail. Obviously, within intermodal container, but also within a boxcar, within a (20: 19), and within a multi-level and as truck capacity tightens, and that's the narrative that we hear from our customers on a daily basis that has volume implications for us and importantly it has pricing implications. Certainly I think we're seeing some of that volume matriculate to us now and the pricing will continue into 2018, as our customers and we go through bid season. With respect to share gains, once again our primary form of competition is truck. We are going to put out a very dependable service product and a very consistent approach. We feel like our customers value that approach. And so that has been reflected in our volumes and in our revenue. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up, as you think about just sort of the whole pricing umbrella. Are you seeing an underlying acceleration in your core pricing growth, whether – I guess compared to the second quarter?\nAlan H. Shaw: As we're renegotiating contracts in the third quarter, we see more strength, particularly on the truck competitive business, as you would expect. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay. Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah, hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to talk a little bit about sort of operating leverage as we think forward and sort of along the lines of the last question. It seems like there is an opportunity for both price as well as volume as you move into next year, truck markets beginning to tighten up. You put together good incremental margins in the third quarter. Just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you think about sort of that cadence as we go forward with the productivity initiatives you have and sort of the pricing, if you put it all together and similar, how you think about that over the next several quarters?\nJames A. Squires: Good morning, Chris. Yes, we have seen a nice trend in operating leverage and incremental margin thus far this year. Looking out, the cadence will depend to some extent on the mix of volume growth we experienced. Cindy, maybe you could address that a little bit further.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yes, sure. Hi, Chris. Yeah. As Jim said, we've seen good incremental margins and I think we expect to see those going forward. Just to remind you, I think we've talked about this before, that we see it's sort of a hierarchy in terms of incremental margins in our business. The highest, of course, is merchandise followed by coal and then intermodal. So, it really will be dependent upon where we see the incremental growth going forward.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. But the setup that we have in terms of what sort of working and sort of a tighter truck market doesn't lead you one way or another when you think about that?\nJames A. Squires: Well, as Alan said, we do see the opportunity from a tightening truck market not only in our intermodal franchise, but in general merchandise as well and there we do have significant incremental margin opportunity. In addition to the extent we're able to price into a tightening truck market, that too should support incremental margin going forward.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow up on head count. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on sort of how you think about the progress in both fourth quarter and then maybe going forward, it sounds like there is some incremental heads may be coming to get advance of some peak business in 2018. But, I just want to make sure I understood the cadence of that? Thank you.\nJames A. Squires: Cindy, why don't you take that one.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yes. So, Chris, certainly we've seen good head count reductions. Our year-over-year head count is down about 1,100. Well, I did mention in my prepared remarks that we expect head count in the fourth quarter to be flat or slightly up and that's really all dependent on our T\u0026E hiring. We're hiring kind of ahead of our peak demand month in the summer and fall going in 2018. So, that's where you're seeing the increases.\nChris Wetherbee: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to ask you about pipeline on productivity and just how we might think of drivers of margin expansion if you look out into 2018. So, I think, you've had a number of structural cost reductions that you put in place over the last few years and you're putting up nice incremental margins and further productivity gains. How do you think, Jim or Mike about what's in the pipeline going into next year in terms of structural cost takeout or just what would support operating leverage and margin expansion next year?\nJames A. Squires: Good morning, Tom. Productivity certainly has been a key driver of financial improvements this year and last and we expect that to continue. We've made a lot of progress in a couple of key areas already. We ticked off some of the records that we achieved in the third quarter as part of Mike's presentation. And yes, there are many additional productivity opportunities in the pipeline. Mike, why don't you comment on that?\nMichael J. Wheeler: Yeah. Okay. So, I would just note that there are some things that are going to run through 2018 that we initiated this year, the reduction or the idling of one of our terminals earlier this year. The 150 locomotives we've taken out of service that was a first half thing that will run through all of next year. And then the division consolidation we told you about before it actually goes into effect next week. So, a lot of those things will run through full year next year. But, we continue to take a look at optimizing the train plan, and as you saw that we had 4% more volume out there. But we reduced crew starts by 2%. So, we handled 4% more volume with 2% less crews. So that's optimizing our train plan and train length. So, we continue to take a look at how we can take costs out of the railroad. It may not necessarily be a big terminal or anything like that, but it's taking costs across the railroad out of the network, but still making sure that we're able to provide the service that our customers are looking for. So, there are a lot of initiatives going on, more to come and we balance out the service, but we're not letting up.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay, that's helpful, maybe just a follow up on that. So, if you look at 2018, what do you think will be the bigger driver of margin expansion, would it be volume growth and that's supporting operating leverage for longer trains and so forth? Or do you think a bigger opportunity is from more of the pure cost or productivity, whether that's facility rationalization, changing the train plan, however, you would frame it?\nJames A. Squires: Tom, ours is a balanced plan, it's balanced, it's dynamic and it's flexible as well and that's why we've been able to consistently deliver strong performance. So our expectation looking into 2018 and beyond is that we will continue to deliver bottom line improvements through a combination of growth and productivity.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Jim, we saw headlines a couple of weeks ago about the various labor unions coming together to come up with an agreement with the Class 1 rails, which is pending ratification from the rank and file. I was wondering if you had any initial thoughts on how that agreement stacks up versus your expectations. Thanks.\nJames A. Squires: We have reached a tentative agreement with a coalition of unions representing about 60% of our employees. It is out for ratification and we'll await the results of ratification before commenting further on the agreement.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. And just as a follow up, I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you quantify any impact from the hurricane in the third quarter and also given that you mentioned that your primary competition is truck, how much customer overlap do you really have with your eastern partner in that, if you have customers who are unhappy with their service, they could look to you as a long-term alternative? Thanks.\nJames A. Squires: We did not quantify any additional expenses as a result of the hurricanes in the third quarter. Alan, why don't you comment on the competitive landscape?\nAlan H. Shaw: Yeah. Our primary form of competition is truck, Ravi. We do share some customers with CSX and as I suggested, we're offering a differentiated service product and a long-term approach of a balance between cost effectiveness and supporting our customers' growth. And so to the extent the customers are looking for dependable service provider, we're there. Our primary focus is on securing business from the highway and we see that spot rates are up 15% in trucking and drive-in over the last couple of months and are up about 25% year-over-year. That's also buttressed by an improving economy in which consumer confidence and the PMI for manufacturing are at effectively 13-year highs. So our focus is on competing with truck. That's been our thesis. That's the opportunity provided to us by operating in the East and that's where we're going to see a lot of growth.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hey, guys. I want to just focus on freight that you might have won from your Eastern competitor due to their service issues in the quarter. It seems like whatever you did take on didn't negatively disrupt your network, and you kept your service levels high. Could you talk a little bit about the thought process of taking on that freight and how likely it is that you're going to retain it?\nJames A. Squires: Sure. I would emphasize that our goal is to grow while pushing hard on productivity as well. So we believe we have an excellent service product in the marketplace that allows us to compete with truck and rail. Alan, talk a little bit about the specifics in terms of market share -rail market share in the quarter?\nAlan H. Shaw: Yeah. Jason, as we've talked before, there is a lot of collaboration within Norfolk Southern about volume opportunities. And our primary focus was on making sure that any volume we brought on was accretive to the bottom line and to our shareholders and did not disrupt the responsibility that we have to our existing customer base to provide a consistent and predictable service product. And so that's how we went into this. We could be judicious with the unit trains that we added, and we look for opportunities to add trains into our scheduled merchandise network and within intermodal. We also make sure that anything we brought on in the short-term did not necessarily reduce our ability to handle additional business at higher returns in the long-term.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That's some good color. And I guess my next question is going to be on the incentive comp. Obviously, it was a little bit higher than I expected. It was actually higher than you saw an increase last year in the third quarter. What should we look for incentive comp in 4Q?\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Hi, Jason. This is Cindy.\nJason Seidl: Hey, Cindy.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah, you did notice, we talked about in the prepared remarks that incentive comp was up $47 million year-over-year. And maybe just a little bit of context. If you think back to 2015, we had a zero bonus, then going into 2016 we did have a bonus but it was a lower leveled bonus. And then this year really based on improving business results, you've seen the incentive comp go up. So when we think about fourth quarter, the expectation was you would see a similar year-over-year increase in incentive comp in the fourth quarter.\nJason Seidl: Okay. That's perfect. Those are my two. I appreciate the time as always, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Congrats on the good results. I wanted to ask if you could just offer some thoughts on growth. I guess relative to the underlying market, there's obviously some idiosyncratic things happening, whether it's market share opportunities, truckload capacity tightening, pricing. So against that backdrop, just wanted to try to get a sense of your thinking about your volume growth, revenue growth actually potential relative to the actual underlying markets that you're serving? Thanks so much.\nJames A. Squires: Balance is really the key. We are aiming to grow, but while achieving ever-improving productivity as well. So, Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about the major verticals and our growth expectations there as outlined in our current long-range plan?\nAlan H. Shaw: Sure. Amit, we're pretty excited about the environment in which we're operating right now. We see truck capacity tightening significantly, buttressed by an improving economy, which should certainly assist our intermodal markets. It will also assist many of our merchandise markets, as we implement – we continue to implement our plan of a strong service foundation, schedules that meet our customers' needs, an equipment strategy that supports growth, technology improvements that optimize the distribution of the equipment and make it easier to do business with us. All of that is part of our strategic plan. It's all designed to compete with truck. And so those are positives for us. As I look into the fourth quarter, I'll draw your attention to export, we're still projecting 5 million tons to 6 million tons of export coal. Recognize last year the fourth quarter was our highest export coal quarter. I think through three quarters, we did about – last year we did about 10 million tons of coal, export in the fourth quarter we did 4.6 million tons. So the comps get a little bit more difficult. We also had a much milder summer in the East and the start to the fall has been mild. And so I think we're going to be somewhat limited in our utility volume in the fourth quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up for me, if I could. And it's really a question about CapEx and cash deployment. The CapEx requirements of the business and really the industry, I guess, are kind of staying where they are today, or if not, going maybe a bit lower over the foreseeable future. Some companies, some of your peers in the U.S. at least have committed to maybe more ambitious share repurchase activity. I wonder if you could talk about that. You've chosen to pay down some debt. I just wanted to see if maybe we should expect a little bit more of a pivot on the cash deployment side towards more of what some of your peers are doing? Thanks.\nJames A. Squires: In terms of capital allocation generally, our approach is very disciplined. We are putting the money back into the business that we need to, to reinvest in the business, to keep our service strong. In terms of shareholder distributions, we're targeting a one-third payout ratio with incremental free cash flow going toward share buybacks. Cindy, talk about the change that we made in the buyback program recently and our expectations for shareholder distributions for the whole year.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yes. So we did announce the board approved $50 million (sic) [50 million] more in share repurchases through 2022. In terms of the share repurchases, we also increased that this year. We started our guiding at about$800 million repurchases and we're at $1 billion. And so going forward, and as Jim said, we have a very disciplined approach to cash deployment. We'll invest back in the business. Our plans are to distribute back to shareholders via dividends and over the long-term get to about a 33% dividend payout ratio, and then we use remaining cash to have share repurchases. So that's our strategy going forward, and I think that's been our approach all along.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, all right. That's very clear, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatthew Troy: Yeah, good morning. Just wanted to get a split. You talked about 4% volume growth in intermodal. I was wondering if you could provide some detail as to what the growth rates were in domestic versus international.\nJames A. Squires: Yeah. Matt, international was down slightly. Of course, we and the ports that we served were impacted by the hurricanes. And so that was somewhat of a drag, and then domestic was up about 7%, 7.5%.\nMatthew Troy: Okay. And is it fair to think, given all the talk and anticipation about capacity issues in trucking and a better pricing environment potentially emerging next year, is the biggest bite of the apple one way you should think about the cadence of pricing improvement in intermodal, is it still – should we still be kind of bogeying the second quarter is where you really get that biggest bite or is it more spread out now?\nJames A. Squires: Well, that is certainly when bid season typically occurs for our customers. We've already negotiated 85% of the revenue for this year. We've already negotiated about 54% of the revenue for next year. So it does, Matt, as you noted, it is tied to the bid season for our customers, and it's also tied to the contract renewals that we have.\nMatthew Troy: Okay. And my one quick follow-up would be, I know you don't guide to core pricing, but it sounds like it's going to be a better year next year. Can you just give us your expectations for rail inflation in 2018? Thank you.\nJames A. Squires: Right now, all-inclusive less fuel is at 1.9% for next year.\nMatthew Troy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And congrats to Jim and team. It's not lost on us that your OR is beating the competition here. But, Jim, I want to ask on those lines. I mean, we've seen a lot of volatility in your company's earnings in the past, especially with swings in export coal. Obviously that market can shut off and turn on very quickly. But it sounds like you're planning for a higher labor cost outlook, higher head count next year, if I'm not mistaken by the comments you've made. So how could you mitigate the risk that maybe that market turns off quickly? What can be done on the cost structure that would keep the OR trajectory heading lower?\nJames A. Squires: The plan is dynamic and flexible, and that's really been the hallmark of our execution over the last couple of years. As you've seen, the business ebb and flow. We have been able to make adjustments and to react to changes in the marketplace. And that's what we'll continue to do. We will continue to drive hard on productivity and growth, wherever growth is available. If market conditions change, we will again adapt and be flexible.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And I hate to nitpick on the call but, Cindy, it looks like your other cost line came in at about $40 million. And if I go back the last few quarters, you've been running, let's call it, somewhere between $75 million and $80 million. I know that you've called out $9 million in the landfill gains, but was there something else that favorably impacted the quarter? Or is that the new run rate that we should be looking at going forward?\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah. Brandon, as you said, I did call out $9 million increase year-over-year in the gain on sale of operating properties. And, obviously, those things change from quarter-to-quarter. It's hard to predict when you're going to have gains. In terms of the large number of gains from year-over-year, in the third quarter, I think we talked about – third quarter of 2016 I think we talked about around $28 million worth of large gains. In this quarter in 2017, we had about $38 million worth of large gains. So that has some impact and that's probably the biggest thing. And, again, it's hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. That's actually very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Jim, I guess, third quarter is typically your best operating ratio and looking at the cost strides you've made, do you need to overhaul ops like counter-suggest to get down to the 60% range? Or can you keep doing the blocking and tackling as you've been doing to get to this point to get that progress? And maybe talk about the – is that a realistic progress for your network to get to over a longer term? I know 65%is your near-term one. And then just your thoughts on the $100 million productivity. You mentioned you beat the target. I guess, maybe thoughts on the potential of scale as you move forward this year.\nJames A. Squires: Sure. Good morning, Ken. So let me begin by emphasizing that we've been making significant progress on our long-term objectives, and achieving and exceeding our goals. So you saw in the third quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement, and that gives us confidence that we're going to be – we'll continue to drive the operating ratio and the bottom line and that we'll get to that sub-65%OR by 2020 or sooner. In terms of productivity, we've said that we expect at least $100 million this year. Right now we think that'll probably be closer to $150 million for the full year.\nKen Hoexter: Great. And is there – have you set a scale for next year yet or is that still just part of this $650 million total?\nJames A. Squires: Well, I can tell you this. We have the pedal to the metal. We are pushing as hard as we possibly can on all aspects of our strategic plan. And we certainly expect to achieve significant additional productivity savings next year and beyond.\nKen Hoexter: And then just a quick one, I guess, Cindy. Long-term debt went up, rates are climbing, but interest expense went down sequentially. Was there anything in that number that altered that interest expense savings?\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Ken, I would say that there was not really anything that would impact that. We did do a payoff of higher-rated debt in the quarter, so that did impact it.\nKen Hoexter: But yet your long-term debt went up sequentially. I guess, I could talk to you offline. It just seems like your long-term debt went up sequentially.\nJames A. Squires: Well, you're seeing older debt at a higher rate roll off...\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Right.\nJames A. Squires: ... and be replaced by new debt at a lower coupon, but ...\nKen Hoexter: Yeah.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah. As part of the exchange, Ken, we exchanged about $550 million into $750 million worth of debt.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Thanks for the insight.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott H. Group: Hey. Thanks. Morning, everyone. So wanted to just kind of revisit the head count and just more broadly the productivity discussion. So obviously nice spread between volume growth and head count this quarter, but we are seeing service issues when we just look at train speeds lower year-over-year. Do you think – are we kind of at the point where we can't cut head count and can't cut locomotives anymore, and it's more just about leverage from volume, or is that not the message? And then if we are sort of at that point where we're seeing some service issues, do you focus more on price than volume next year? I know you're going to say you're going to focus on both, but if you had to kind of prioritize price versus volume next year, how would you answer that?\nJames A. Squires: Okay. Let's talk about service before, and I'll comment generally and then Cindy can go back over our expectations for head count this year. And then, Mike, maybe you can weigh in on kind of the resource balance. With respect to service generally, we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service that our customers value. That's key to the value proposition. For the third quarter as a whole, we saw network performance rebound back to first quarter levels and roughly target composite service metric levels. And in that context, we were able to grow volume and the top line, while providing a high-level service product to our customers. So that's the paradigm. That's what we will be looking to do going forward. Now, Mike, why don't you start and talk a little bit about the resource balance, and then Cindy will come back in and talk about where we expect head count to go?\nMichael J. Wheeler: Yeah. So it's not like we don't have opportunities out there as we continue to look at the network and see what business grows on the network, where we can optimize the cost. We still have resources available to us from the locomotives. We have about almost 400 units stored and available that'll help us handle growth, but it doesn't mean we're not looking at finding ways to reduce the cost structure of the railroad long-term. A lot of initiatives going on. We've already talked about the ones we've done this year that are rolled through. We're not giving up on any of that. But I'll say that we also make sure that we've got to have a good service product. And Jim noted, it did improve sequentially over the quarter and you noted some increases in dwell and train speed. I would just point out that at the end of the third quarter, we had several hurricanes that hit our partners on the West and as well as two of them that impacted us. And we held some traffic in our terminals for that until our customers got back up to speed, or our partners got back up to speed. But really no damage to our railroad and we rebounded quickly. So that's kind of what you're seeing. So we feel comfortable about where we're going on further cost reductions but still making sure that we are taking care of the service.\nJames A. Squires: Now with regard to head count specifically, Cindy did state that we expect head count to be flat to up slightly at the end of this year versus today. But there's a specific reason for that. So, Cindy, go over the training cycle and the onboarding process.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Sure. As I said, the flat to slightly up was really completely dependent upon hiring ahead of what we see peak demand season for crews in the summer and the fall of 2018. As you know, the cycle to hire and train and have those folks available takes several months to get that done. So that's really what's driving the head count. As I said before, 1,100 folks down quarter-over-quarter, that's really across the company in all areas. And productivity is extremely important to us, and we're going to be pushing on that, again, in all areas. And we look very closely at T\u0026E, and you'll note that I think our volumes were up year-to-date about 5%, and we've really held the T\u0026E head count pretty flat throughout the year. So it's something that we look very, very closely at.\nJames A. Squires: Yeah. And that bump up is in the neighborhood of maybe 200 more employees for the next ...\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Right.\nJames A. Squires: ... quarter or so until we get them ready to go out there. So it's slightly up and it's by design.\nScott H. Group: So that's helpful. I don't know, Alan, if you addressed kind of that price versus volume prioritization point. And then just to clarify on the head count, I think earlier in the year, you said, hey, we may need to add some T\u0026E, but there's still non-T\u0026E that we can reduce. Are we running out of that non-T\u0026E to reduce?\nJames A. Squires: Bob, I'll take that one. Look, the focus is on all areas of head count, as Cindy said. We are looking at all aspects of employment and staffing and looking for reductions and have achieved reductions across the board. Now with regard to your price-versus-volume question, it really isn't a question of price versus volume. It is both, and we are looking to achieve both volume growth and price increases commensurate with the service product we have out in the marketplace.\nScott H. Group: Okay. And then, if I can just ask one more, Alan. So you talked about some of the weather issues in coal. Any way to give a preliminary view on export and then domestic coal for next year? Meaning, do you think the run rates that you talked about for fourth quarter are sustainable into '18, or do we need to reset those lower for '18?\nAlan H. Shaw: For export coal, what we're hearing, Scott, is that that market has legs through – potentially through the first half of next year. A lot of the run up in price has been event driven, which isn't necessarily good, but I think it also supports the theory that the market out there for export coal is fairly tight. Although I can paint the other picture. As you're aware, API 2is backwardated right now. So that suggests it's going down. But the best I can do, Scott, is kind of tell you what we're hearing, which I just did, and then point you towards the economic metrics that we're looking at or indicators that we're looking at. With respect to utility coal, that's going to be highly dependent upon the weather. Natural gas prices are pretty similar to where they are – were at this time last year. Stockpiles are down slightly versus last year. I think they're down about where they were at like 79 days, they're off about 22 days from the high, which was May 2016. And really what happens in the first quarter and second quarter next year is going to be dependent upon weather patterns in the East in the winter. Does it make sense?\nScott H. Group: Okay. Yeah, now it does. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Alan, I think you mentioned a little over half of your revenue for 2018 is negotiated at this point. Given that visibility, could you just talk high level about how the price increases for that business compared to the last pricing up-cycle that we saw? I'm just curious if you could provide some perspective on how the pricing environment next year could compare to the acceleration we saw in 2014 and '15?\nAlan H. Shaw: Sure. So, Justin, the – as I think I noted, the contracts that we renegotiated in the third quarter generally had a higher level of increase than what we were able to secure in the second quarter. So that's a positive for us. I'll note that one of the things that really supported year-over-year rate increases this year within coal was the export market, and we certainly don't expect that level of run up next year. As trucking firms, we've got a lot of business that's transactional, and that is going to offer support for pricing.\nJustin Long: Okay. But if you look at those non-coal businesses and where pricing is coming in for next year, I mean is that roughly in line with what you saw when things picked up in 2014 and 2015?\nAlan H. Shaw: You know there was a lag there too because the uptick was relatively sharp, certainly a lot sharper than folks had anticipated generally in March 2014. We might be a little bit ahead of it this year in terms of the outlook because the commentary about the tightening truck market has been out there for a bit, particularly associated around ELD. So we're certainly factoring that into our conversations with our customers and our bid approach, and frankly our customers are having those same kind of conversations with their customers.\nJustin Long: Okay, and maybe as a quick follow-up. On the last call you talked about roughly 50% to 60% of your revenue that's typically renegotiated each year. When you look at what's left, or I guess that other call it 50% or so or a little under 50% for next year, is there any color you can provide on the commodity breakdown of this revenue that's still left for renewal? I'm just curious if it's more weighted towards the specific business or commodity group?\nAlan H. Shaw: Well, we've moved more towards shorter-term pricing in export so that has to be renegotiated. But once again that's less than 3% of our overall volume. With intermodal, there are defined escalators, but there's also transactional business and that has offered support for us. I note that even this quarter we had RPU growth in all seven of our major groups. Same thing we had in second quarter. Second quarter, I would say, truck capacity was loose; third quarter truck capacity tightened and we were able to continue that March.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian P. Ossenbeck: Hi, good morning. So, Alan, just wanted to see if you've thought through some of the contingencies that might need to be put in place if there was trade disruption with Mexico given all the rhetoric and headlines of NAFTA, so if you could give us a sense of how much volume and revenues for Norfolk are really tied to cross-border trade?\nJames A. Squires: Good morning, Brian. Let me say that we are certainly pro-trade as a company and an industry, and in favor of trade regimes that promote cross-border flows. Alan, comment specifically on scenarios for us.\nAlan H. Shaw: Hey, Brian, it is a – it's a very small component of our revenue. We have every intention of growing that and we're working on opportunities to put together products that would improve that. But, it's something that we're monitoring very closely where there have been four negotiations so far and there are three more that are scheduled.\nBrian P. Ossenbeck: Right. And to clarify small meaning like less than 5%, is there a threshold you would consider putting that below?\nAlan H. Shaw: Yes.\nBrian P. Ossenbeck: Okay. And then one for Mike. You talked a lot about train lengths increasing. And then you have obviously had a great run with that. At this point, there – and you talked about balancing it with service. Is there any point in the East specifically, where you have to worry about longer trains potentially blocking some grade crossings or interfering with some commuter traffic or other traffic patterns, you might cause some congestion in local communities because we are starting to hear a little bit of concern from the regulators just in the East region in general on that aspect in particular?\nMichael J. Wheeler: Yeah. So on the train length, we go to great effort to make sure train lengths don't impact grade crossings. I mean, we try to keep our grade crossings clear and make a big effort at that. So train length isn't really that much of an issue for us in that. It can be making sure that certain single-track territories have enough capacity but that is really a small area for us. So, overall, train length continues to grow. And I'll just note this so far into the fourth quarter continues to look good. So, we're very selective about what we do. We've got a lot of planning that goes into it. So to make sure that we don't create the problems that you're talking about, because we're very, very mindful of those.\nBrian P. Ossenbeck: Okay. Well, thanks for the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions here. So, I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions on what the tightening trucking market really means for Norfolk next year. And specifically, do your contractual obligations to your key domestic intermodal partners in the intermodal business there in the \""defined escalators\"" that you mentioned in response to Justin's question, give you the flexibility to push harder on intermodal pricing next year?\nAlan H. Shaw: Bascome, I think, the key is the opportunity for both us and our channel partners in a tightening truck environment. We have – we have strong relationships with channel partners throughout the intermodal business and we expect to grow along with them. So, we see it as a win-win for NS and its channel partners.\nBascome Majors: I mean, are you suggesting that it's really more about for you volume than pricing next year, just given some of the constraints in your contracts or is there an opportunity to dip more aggressively in both?\nAlan H. Shaw: We see it as an opportunity to grow both volume and rate next year.\nBascome Majors: Thank you. And I just want to clarify one other comment that you made. You're talking about adding employees to get ahead of the peak – peak T\u0026E training period in the spring and summer. Are there any furloughed employees that could potentially be brought back at a lower cost and lead time compared to kind of the six month to nine month training of brand new employees that you talked about in the past when head count is getting a little tighter?\nJames A. Squires: No, we pretty much got all the furloughs back, just maybe a handful less double-digit – low double digits at best. So, no, we don't – we don't have that out there, but we stay in close coordination with marketing as to what they see. And you talked about the six months to nine months, we spend a lot of time reducing that timeframe down also. So we do two things. One, we feel like we can bring them back and get them – or bring them on board and get them qualified quicker. And we're pretty surgical about when we hire them so that they're available when we need them. So those are the two things that make us feel good about having the right T\u0026E crew base ahead of when we need them.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSuneel Manhas: Good morning. This is Suneel Manhas on for Walter Spracklin. Just wanted to circle back real quickly to CapEx, how should we be thinking of your CapEx here given the volume growth, specifically like at what point could there be requirement for incremental CapEx to support the growth?\nJames A. Squires: Well, we're working on our capital plan for 2018, even as we speak. We'll have more to say about that early next year. But I will say this, ours is a very disciplined approach to capital spending. We're looking to maximize returns on capital from our capital spending plan going forward. And that will include the usual categories of capital spending, both maintenance spending and growth spending.\nSuneel Manhas: And just a quick follow-up, on the savings and the expectation initiatives you noted, are there certain regions of your network or lanes where you see the most opportunity?\nJames A. Squires: I'm sorry. I didn't understand the first part of the question. Could you repeat that?\nSuneel Manhas: So yeah, sorry. So on the productivity savings you're expecting for Q4 and you mentioned expectations for further savings into 2018. Are there certain regions of your network or lanes where you see the most opportunity?\nJames A. Squires: Productivity really is a network-wide opportunity. So we see opportunities to drive productivity throughout our network.\nSuneel Manhas: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good morning. I also wanted to dig in on the record train length a little bit. Can you talk about where you're making those gains and what I'm driving at there is – I assume that your coal network is close to optimal. So I'm curious if you're seeing improvement in merchandise or intermodal or both?\nMichael J. Wheeler: Yeah, the answer is both. Intermodal has been the biggest driver, but merchandise as well, and you're right, the coal unit trains have been optimized for a while. I will tell you on some of the other unit trains, stone and agriculture, we have increased those in coordination with our customers. So Intermodal is the big driver but merchandise is also growing as well.\nCherilyn Radbourne: And just by way of a quick follow-up, you've been seeing some puts and takes in terms of the merchandise volumes, is that creating any challenges in terms of making improvements in the merchandise network?\nJames A. Squires: Well, Alan, why don't you go back over the merchandise growth trend in the quarter and let's use that as the foundation for addressing her question about train sizes and operations and the merchandise network generally?\nJames A. Squires: Yeah, Cherilyn. We started to see some fairly robust growth sequentially as we moved through the third quarter effectively up until the hurricane started to impact our customer base and so it took a pause and September has started to rebound in the fourth quarter and we're seeing strength in steel, we're seeing strength in frac sand, seeing a little bit of crude oil although that will be a year-over-year decline, but it's picking up sequentially. Automotive will post better comps in the fourth quarter year-over-year than it did in the third quarter as U.S. vehicle production declines are year-over-year less. And Ag has kind of got off to a slow start in the quarter due to delayed harvest although within the last seven days we started to see that volume pick up as well.\nJames A. Squires: So much of the growth that Alan just went through in the merchandise arena has occurred within our scheduled train network and that's one reason why you're seeing the incrementals you're seeing. We're also seeing some growth in unit trains as well.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you. That's some helpful color, particularly on the volume side. That's all from me.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nBen J. Hartford: Hey. My quick question for you on the topics of dwell and train velocity addressed earlier. Is it fair to assume that you're expecting improvements in both of those measures in 2018? Obviously the hurricane disruptions aside just as volume growth decelerates from peak 2Q levels, one? And then two, if so, what is kind of a longer term target for both of those metrics? Can we view the 2012, 2013 levels as high watermarks and do you have visibility to returning to or perhaps exceeding those in both dwell and velocity?\nJames A. Squires: Yeah. I think, those are both numbers that we feel very comfortable about not only achieving, but also very comfortable about – gave us a really good service product that allowed our customers to grow on a railroad. So, yeah, we do expect those to improve into 2018. Absolutely.\nBen J. Hartford: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nJ. David Scott Vernon: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Alan, I want to ask you a little bit about the pricing opportunity in intermodal. If you go back the last 10-years, 15-years, the intermodal RPU for Norfolk hasn't really budged that much despite a 3% inflation in highway cost and a higher oil price and all that. Is there something about the market dynamic or the density you have in your network that's giving you a little bit better leverage to pricing in intermodal over the next 5-years to 10-years. Just wondering how those negotiations are going with shippers and what's giving you a chance to maybe take a little bit more price up relative to truck than you have in the past?\nAlan H. Shaw: Well, David, what's occurred is that, we're starting to see a much tighter truck environment and we've got some market approach that our customers value. We've got a service product with schedules that meet their needs. And, so, our conversation with them is how do we grow together. And we firmly believe that negotiated rate increases reflect the value of your service product, and we're leaning in the price. We're not putting new dots on the map. We've got our capacity. We'll continue to invest in the big areas like Chicago and Atlanta, but our focus is on utilizing the existing capacity that we have to – and leaning in the price to drive shareholder return.\nJ. David Scott Vernon: Are you passing up on a little bit more of the business that might be out there right now relative to maybe you were 5 years, 10 years ago?\nAlan H. Shaw: Five years, 10 years ago, we implemented some Corridor strategies which have been very beneficial to us. For instance, the Heartland Corridor, we put in the – handled business between the Ohio Valley and Chicago, and Norfolk. And as volume moves to the East Coast ports, that's something that's going to support our growth. And we've got the capacity in place. Now it's our opportunity to leverage it.\nJames A. Squires: David, one thing to bear in mind, as you look at the trend in our intermodal RPU over, say, the last five years is the effect of the Triple Crown downsizing. Our Triple Crown business had a significantly higher RPU than the average intermodal RPU. And when we, for all intents and purposes, shut down that business, it did have a dampening effect on reported RPU, albeit it was the best thing for the bottom line.\nJ. David Scott Vernon: All right. I appreciate that color. And then maybe, Cindy, just as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a range for what we should be expecting on property sales on a kind of annual rolling basis here and kind of whether or how the property sales impact management incentives on EBIT and OR?\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah. David, it's really hard to tell you how property sales are going to come in from quarter-to-quarter, as I said before. I mean, they're obviously going to and it – operating sales will have an impact on our OR, which does impact our incentive plans. I will tell you though that when you look at our operating property sales in the third quarter, they were – our improvement in OR year-over-year was not dependent upon those property sales. And we expect fourth quarter that will also have year-over-year operating ratio improvements and they will not be dependent upon those sales.\nJ. David Scott Vernon: But is Norwalk maybe using property sales as a little bit more of a lever here for OR just given that the incentives in place and should we be expecting more relative to trend or is it just going to come up how it comes up?\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah. I mean, I think that obviously we will always look at property that we have that's no longer used in the business and we'll try to get rid of it. And as I said, it's very difficult to predict. Getting rid of that property is part of our strategy, but at the end of the day, it's really not going to be a big driver of our OR. The things that we talk about, service, productivity and growth, are going to be the things that drive our OR.\nJ. David Scott Vernon: All right. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nPatrick Tyler Brown: Hey. Good morning. Hey, Alan. It seems like the prospects for domestic intermodal look really strong. I think the volumes are at record levels. But I was wondering if you could talk about IMC box availability. And second, do you and your pool partners have any plans to add to the E\u0026P fleet to maybe support growth or do you feel like there's enough capacity there?\nAlan H. Shaw: Tyler, capacity is tight with boxes, which is good for pricing opportunities, particularly on the transactional level. As Jim noted, we're currently in the process of developing our capital plan for 2018.\nPatrick Tyler Brown: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jim, this is more of a strategic question and I can't remember where I saw you speak. I think it was one of the Rail Shipper conferences. But I recall your presentation was really revolving around NS's strategy about revamping how you face the customer. So I was just curious, if you or Alan could just talk about where you are in that program, maybe what kind of initiatives, maybe technologies that we and customers would expect? And then what do you hopefully hope to yield from these investments?\nJames A. Squires: Well, I'll quickly turn it over to Cindy to go through some of these specific technology investments that we are making. But first, I do want to reiterate the importance to our strategy of customer engagement and customer interface. We are working hard to get closer and stay closer to our customers. And one of the main ways we're doing that is through investments we're making in technology.\nCindy Cynthia Earhart: Yeah. So, let me just add a little bit of color to that. As Jim said, we are investing quite a bit in the way that we interact with customers. And I would characterize it maybe in three different areas. The first is – our – how we face the customer. We have a big project to upgrade our portal and basically change not just the look and feel of it, but really everything behind it; the data, the data accuracy, the timeliness. We want to make it very easy for customers to be able to get the information that they need when they need it. We are, secondly, working on what we call customer relationship management, which is really technology within this company, so that no matter where you are in the company, marketing, accounting, transportation, customer service, we all have one view of the customer. We all have the most relevant data and we can interact with the customer having that type of information and managing issues. And then I think the third part is we are looking very closely at the technology that we have implemented within our customer service center and looking to upgrade that, so we can better serve our customers. So, a lot of effort around that multiyear project, but we think will be very beneficial for both us and our customers.\nJames A. Squires: And, Tyler, it's...\nPatrick Tyler Brown: Yeah.\nAlan H. Shaw: It's an ongoing process, as Cindy said. We're implementing some things now, some things we're investing ahead of the curve in some areas and some things we'll be rolling out next year. The foundation of it is a predictable service product. What differentiates us is our equipment strategy for growth homogenizing the fleet that offers for better asset turns, that offers better equipment reliability, the ability to provide equipment in safe working order to our customers on time, better transparency for our customers, it's a customer engagement focused on proactive notification and a seamless interface with the customer. It's collaboration with our short line partners and economic development partners to extend our network reach, it's innovative service products that utilize and generate a return on our existing assets. All those things are part of our strategy to differentiate ourselves and help us compete with truck.\nJames A. Squires: And let me just close this subject by pointing out that all of these different initiatives we've described are coming to fruition now and will continue to do so in the future. This has been a major emphasis and focus of our team since I became CEO. And, Alan, Mike, Cindy and I have all spent a lot of time with our customers gathering their input, their ideas for improvement and how we can refine and improve our service product and that's where those ideas came from and that's why we are driving so hard to implement them.\nPatrick Tyler Brown: Yeah. Perfect. Now – sounds extremely interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comment.\nJames A. Squires: Thank you. Thank you all for your questions. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their contributions to a record breaking quarter. Our balanced and successful approach focused on increasing efficiency and delivering a strong customer service product gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our goals and deliver sustainable value. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Please note, this presentation describes certain non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share, which are not measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The non-GAAP measures are presented in this presentation, as we believe they provide investors with the means of evaluating and understanding how the company's management evaluates the company's operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, or substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Listeners who do not have a copy of the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 press release or the presentation may obtain a copy by visiting the Investors section of the company's website. Now, I will turn the call over to CEO, Guy Sella.\nGuy Sella: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us on our conference call today. We concluded the quarter with revenues of $189.3 million and record gross margin of 37.5%. We have a non-GAAP net income of $41.2 million and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 and we generated $45.8 million of positive cash flow from operations. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we shipped 766 megawatts of AC nameplate inverters, approximately 461 megawatt of which was shipped to North America. Overall, this quarter, we shipped over 2 million power optimizers and 95,000 inverters. As anticipated, we have continued to grow our revenues and were able to overcome a challenging year in terms of industry wide components availability, while expanding our manufacturing capability to meet the growing demand for our products. Looking at our year-over-year figures reveal strong results. We are reporting annual record revenues for 2017 of $607 million compared to $490 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and an annual non-GAAP net income of over $115 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $79 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal 2017 is $2.43 compared to $1.72 in the prior year. This year, we generated $136.7 million in cash from operations, an increase from the calendar year that ended December 31, 2016 when we generated $81 million in cash. Profitability and the strong balance sheet is a key to long term success in this industry and it is critical to being able to support the 25 years warranty that characterize module-level power electronics products. As it’s evident from our strong financial performance, our business is growing at a healthy rate. We continue to stay focused on our bottom line numbers. On this front, we expanded our gross margin by keeping our ASP stable, continuing our cost reduction initiatives and as a result, increased profitability and cash flow generation. We continue to invest significant resources in growing our R\u0026D and customer support infrastructure to address our expanding geographic footprint with new, more cost efficient products and even better services. We have maintained a relatively stable ASP and our annual gross margin for 2017 reached a record high of 35.4%. We are starting to see products from Chinese manufacturer that has recently introduced optimizer with a reduced set of features and relatively high pricing in Australia. There have been market rumors about this for some time now and we have heard the product will be introduced in Europe as well. From what we have seen so far, the products have only basic functionality and led communication features and a safety mechanism. We expect their market penetration will be challenging, especially in the United States and leaving Western European countries that are mindful of putting quality products on rooftop and are cautious of security concerns that relate to PV systems and their effect on electrical grid, if not properly secured against cyberattacks. I would like to mention our recently announced co-operation with Japanese technology leader Omron Corporation. Last month, Omron announced that they will be offering SolarEdge three-phase DC optimized inverter solution, consisting of inverters, power optimizers and module-level monitoring to the high voltage Japanese PV market. As part of the launch, SolarEdge will supply high-voltage, three-phase inverters and power optimizers to Omron for local distribution and sales. Omron’s after-sales service network of 140 locations will address the Japanese markets for the SolarEdge solution. This cooperation with a very prestige and well known technology leader in Japan and worldwide is another indication of our success in establishing the SolarEdge brand as a market leader in the PV solutions. To conclude, our products have now been in the market and gaining market acceptance for more than seven years. We remain confident in our technology leadership, superior customer services, quality and reliability as well our financial strength, which will help us to maintain our market leadership even as these products surface. Given our growth outside of the United States and our continued investment in new markets and in different regions, we are confident that we can continue to grow our revenues in 2018. And with this, I hand the speaker over to Ronen who will review our financial results.\nRonen Faier: Thank you, Guy and good afternoon, everyone. Before starting the review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, I would like to remind listeners that while the overview will be on a GAAP basis, in certain cases, I will be discussing non-GAAP numbers and measures, which exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and deferred taxes as well as non-GAAP earning per share. Full reconciliation of the pro-forma to GAAP result discussed on this call is available on our website and in the press release issued today. Now, let's start with the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Total revenues were $189.3 million, a 13.7% increase compared to 166.6 million last quarter, and an increase of 69.8% from revenues of 111.5 million in the same period last year. This quarter, revenues from the United States reached $120.4 million, a record high in absolute numbers and represented 63.6% of our overall quarterly revenues. Sales to Europe were $47 million and represented 24.8% of our quarterly revenue. You may recall that the winter months are often characterized with a slower business in this region. Revenue generated from sales outside of the United States and Europe reached a record high of 21.9 million, representing 11.6% of our total revenue. From a customer concentration perspective, our top 10 customers represented 62.3% of our quarterly revenue, while only one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. On a per watt basis, blended ASP slightly decreased this quarter mainly due to geographic and product mix, while the per product basis, a slight ASP increase was offset by an increase of our commercial sales in the overall mix. Gross margins for the quarter were 37.5% compared to 34.9% in the prior quarter and 35% in the same quarter last year. This record gross margin level is a result of the stable ASP environment, combined with continued cost reduction initiatives that lower our product manufacturing costs. As was anticipated, we spent more on air shipments in order to accommodate increased product demand and industry wide component availability issues. On the flip side, fixed expenses related to our manufacturing and support represented lower percentage of our revenues. Our current gross margin level is consistent with the top range of the long term model, which we communicated to investors when we went public in 2015 and we believe that absent unusual circumstances, we can maintain it in the foreseeable future. Moving to operating expenses, R\u0026D expenses were $16.4 million, an increase of 14.3% compared to the previous quarter and an increase of 58.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase, mainly attributed to an increase in headcount, is consistent with our decision to invest resources in product development and innovation, cost reduction and advanced manufacturing processes that will allow us to continue to bring new products to the market as well as reduce the cost of our current products and further improve their quality. Our financial strength and growing profitability fuel these investments. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $14.1 million, an increase of 6.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 35.3% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is driven by our continued investment in the countries in which we operate already and the expansion of our geographic footprint. G\u0026A expenses were $5.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 16.2% from the prior quarter and an 88.7\u0026 increase compared to the same quarter last year, mainly resulting from a one-time litigation expense that we initiated in Q3 and concluded in Q4. In total, operating expenses for the fourth quarter were 36.4 million or 19.2% of revenue compared to 32.7 million or 19.6% of revenue in the prior quarter and 23.9 million or 21.4% of revenue for the same quarter last year. As a result of all of the factors just discussed, our operating income for the quarter reached a record high of $34.6 million compared to 25.4 million in the previous quarter and $15.1 million for the same period last year. Financial income for the quarter was $1.5 million compared to a financial income of 2.7 million in the previous quarter and a financial expense of $3.2 million for the same period last year. This financial income is a result of favorable exchange rate gains and interest earned on our investment. Let's turn now to income tax expenses that were impacted this quarter by the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017. GAAP tax expenses this quarter were $16.6 million compared to a tax expense of 0.1 million in the prior quarter and $2.2 million for the same period last year. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we booked provisional net text charge of $18.7 million, primarily due to one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax that is included only in our GAAP results. This provision for a one-time repatriation tax, which is related to earnings and profit accumulated outside of the United States in 2017 and in prior years, was fully recorded this quarter. However, payment of the repatriation tax will be spread over the next eight years, beginning of April 2018 with the majority of the payment due in the last three years of this eight year period. The good news is that other than the reduced tax rate in the United States, we will benefit from the new tax law by having the ability to access our cash out in the United States in a highly efficient manner. As a result, we have a greater flexibility with respect to our overall capital allocation and investment decision. On a non-GAAP basis, our tax expenses were $0.2 million compared to $1 million last quarter and 0.7 million for the same quarter last year. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $19.5 million compared to a GAAP net income of 28 million for the previous quarter and $9.8 million for the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net income was $41.2 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of 31.5 million in the previous quarter and $14.7 million for the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted earning per share was $0.42 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.61 in the previous quarter and $0.22 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted EPS was $0.85 compared to $0.66 in the previous quarter and $0.32 in the same quarter last year. Turning now to the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments were $345.1 million compared to 304.7 million at September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $45.8 million in cash from operations. Accounts receivable net increased this quarter, reaching $109.5 million compared to 91.7 million last quarter, while DSO remained relatively flat. As of December 31, 2017, our inventory level net of reserve was at $83 million compared to 62.4 million in the prior quarter. Let's turn now to summarize the 2017 full year results. Revenues for the year were 607 million, a 23.9% increase from 490 million in the calendar year of 2016. GAAP gross margin was 35.4%, compared to 32.8% in the prior year. GAAP operating expenses were $123.7 million, representing 20.4% of revenues compared to 89.7 million in 2016, which represented 18.3% of revenue. GAAP net income for 2017 was $84.2 million, a 32.7% increase compared to 63.5 million in the prior year and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 compared to $1.44 in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $115 million, a 45.8% increase compared to 78.9 million in 2016 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.43 compared to $1.72 in the prior year. This year, we generated $136.7 million of cash from operations. Moving on to the guidance for the first quarter of 2018, we expect revenues to be within the range of $200 million to $210 million and expect gross margins to remain flat within the range of 36% to 38%. I will now turn the call over to the operator to open it up for questions. Operator, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go to Philip Shen, Roth Capital Partners.\nPhilip Shen: Hey, Guy and Ronen, congrats on the results and the success that you’re having in general. First question I have is about components. I think you gave some color, but I was wondering if we can get a little bit more, this is certainly an industry wide problem. Can you give us some more detail as to how you were able to sidestep the challenges there and if you could quantify what the actual impact due to the shortage of components were in Q4? That would be helpful. And then to what degree, have you quantified that impact or captured that impact for the Q1 guide?\nGuy Sella: So I think we gave some color and detailed explanation in the past, but practically, the shortage is coming -- started -- nobody understood it, but it started in the end of 2016 where reversely suppliers of high voltage [indiscernible] capacitors found out that their book to bill was 170%. Back then, they didn't understand that it's really coming from a demand, so they basically gave up the understanding only in February to April depending on the supplier 2017. The assumption was that this is supposed to, that it’s supposed to fix itself sometime in the middle of 2018. What we did is obvious. In one hand, we were growing. On the other hand, we had to put major part of our resources in one phase, three phase and optimizers in order to develop second sources and in some cases, different layouts to accommodate other components for these purposes. We overcome the majority of the effect already in Q2, Q3 2017, but the combination of the shortage of component plus the growth in demand basically reduced dramatically the on hand finished goods inventory we had and we reported all these if you remember. Therefore, we started to move much more into air shipments. We overall supply practically 100% of all demand. Of course at the higher prices, we had to buy some components at the marketplace instead of directly from suppliers. We had to ship big volumes in air shipment. That were the two effects that we saw in Q3 and Q4. Starting 2018, we went to the major component suppliers and currently from what they can see, the over demand for the same components they mentioned will be with us according to them until mid-2019. Today, we have much more resources for those major component and we have, we of course put in April -- last year April to June, we put very big orders for major suppliers for 2017 and ’18. So, we secured we believe enough components and therefore I believe that slowly we’ll start to build more finished goods inventory, but it will probably take another two, maybe three quarters until the majority of the effect will be behind us. These are under the assumption that we analyze the growth of 2018 properly. If we'll see higher growth than anticipated, it might be with us until 2019.\nPhilip Shen: Well, congrats on -- great job on sidestepping mostly the issue in general. We've heard in our checks that lead times with key customers are kind of in the 12 plus week timeframe. So should we expect that to continue? So it seems like the volumes are good. You could get maybe some incremental volume, if you cut some of the lead times down or is the volume actually steady and you can just get the wait times down over time and when do you expect to get that wait time down to the typical three to five weeks.\nGuy Sella: That's what I mentioned. If we -- we have that, as I mentioned in the script, we assume, as I told you last year, we assume nice growth in 2018. Assuming that our assumptions are properly analyzed, we will need probably two to three quarters to overcome the demand and to short the lead time. I cannot promise that we can short it to three to five weeks. It depends on the type of the product and the location or many other parameters, but once we reach there, finished goods inventory in our model, then we go back to the lead time that we had in 2015, ’16, which was in the range of four weeks if I’m not mistaken.\nPhilip Shen: And let's shift gears to the overall mix. I think you guys talked about 160 plus million of US revenues in Q4. Can you share for Q4, what the megawatts were by region? US and then other regions and then where was the strength beyond the US? What was the mix between Europe and Australia and elsewhere? And then looking ahead into 2018, how do you expect that geographic next either in dollars or megawatts or both to evolve?\nGuy Sella: So the total was 761 megawatt or 461 -- 766 sorry, where 461 came from North America. The rest if I remember properly, 24% came from Europe and the rest from mainly Australia, Japan, India and a little bit Israel and other small markets. As I mentioned in the past, on a yearly basis, I believe that in 2018, we’ll end the year where 50% or a little bit less coming from the North America and probably around 45%, 45% to 50% coming from North America where the rest is coming from Europe and rest of the word. For our longer term model, probably for 2019, ’20, it will be 33% from North America, 33% from Europe and 33% from Asia. And we are getting there. Japan is growing nicely. Australia is growing nicely. India is growing nicely. I think we are in the right direction to blend the total revenues in the form I just gave you.\nOperator: And we’ll go next to Mark Strouse, JPMorgan.\nMark Strouse: So could you just give an initial indicator of the launch of the one to two kilowatt resi product, just anything you can share there? I know it's so early. And then, I believe the initial launch was just in Europe. Can you just talk about potentially when you might expand that to other markets?\nGuy Sella: So we just started to take orders for this product. So far, we see a nice demand, but just the very beginning. Currently, we're in the middle of the Chinese New Year. So during Chinese New Year, we're not producing any new product from the – reasons that you understand, you don't want to take risk or the lines are not full of all the engineers, et cetera. We’re supposed to start to produce mass production, first batches, right after Chinese New Year. So in the last week of February, beginning of March, March, we see a nice demand for the product. It opens us a segment that is mainly European segment of new house as an installation of one to two kilowatt that we weren’t playing before this product at. We are looking now what will be the effect of that product in other regions. We're probably going to know in about a quarter when and where we want to start to sell these products as well. A lot depends on the actual volume -- actual demand we’ll see in Europe due to all the good reasons that you prefer to first supply all the demand in one region before you open more demand and maybe might have issues with supplying it.\nMark Strouse: And then Ronen, I'm sorry if I missed this, just real quick. Just talk about the expectations for ASPs in 2018? I believe on the last call, you mentioned down about 7.5% to 10%. Is that still about right?\nRonen Faier: So in general, when we look at the ASP erosions, our expectation were usually about 7.5% to 10%, absent of something that really changes the market from competitive landscape. In general, we still see these as a working assumption as long as we don't see anything else because one of the reasons that we put this expectation is in order to match it with our cost reduction targets as well and as such, these are the assumptions that we see. Last year, in 2017, I believe that we saw or at least on a per product basis, we saw almost a flat environment. So this 7.5% to 10% did not really happen and we do not see at least now major changes in the competitive environment, but at least as the working assumption, the 7.5% to 10% can continue and prevail.\nGuy Sella: That's on a blended ASP. I think that there will be bigger differences here between the ASP erosion on one phase inverters and commercial inverters. As mentioned, we reached what we believe is a good working point of 37% gross margin and we will the effect of better cost in order to gain market share. So of course, in specific segment, specific products, et cetera, et cetera, but we will work our way to keep the gross margin flat and to gain market share with the extra benefit of improved cost we will have.\nOperator: And we will go to Jeffrey Osborne, Cowen and Company.\nJeffrey Osborne: Just a quick question following up on Phil’s question, did you quantify the gross margin impact from the MOSFET IGBT shortage? I think last quarter you talked about 150 basis point hit to gross margins we’re having to airship. If you’ve answered that I missed it. Then I have two other questions.\nGuy Sella: So in general, we quantify, but it's a number that again, once -- now that we got to the area of the 37% that we said from the very beginning that this is the top of the model, we have many levers that we can play in order to make sure that we get to the targets that we want from growth perspective and from, I would call it, market share perspective. And as such, we're playing with those levers within this 37%. So at any given point of time, we can increase air shipments if we would like to sell a little bit more, we can reduce prices, if we want to take more market share. And we have the cost reduction ability to do these. So although we quantify it, I don't think that there is a lot of value in actually taking it as an assumption because if we need to airship a little bit more, a little bit less, we can simply use other leverages in order to have our gross margin stabilize at the level that we wanted to be.\nJeffrey Osborne: Two other questions and I may have missed this as well. But did you give the C\u0026I mix in the quarter and what that was either percentage of revenue, percentage of units, that will be helpful to add?\nGuy Sella: So we did not give, but we can give it now. Last quarter, it was 32.7%. This quarter, it was 33.1%.\nJeffrey Osborne: And as units or revenue.\nGuy Sella: This is on megawatt shipped.\nJeffrey Osborne: And then just given that Omron’s new, my last question, how do we think about you leveraging them. My assumption is that that might be somewhat dilutive to gross margin, but equivalent or maybe even better on operating margin, given your leveraging there, OpEx and distribution, but just how do we think about it if Japan were to become notable or a significant contributor to the P\u0026L, what that would look like?\nGuy Sella: Not necessarily, I wouldn't tweak the models because of the collaboration with Omron in one hand. Prices in Japan are high so gross margin won’t affect on the company level. On the other hand, I'm very happy with this collaboration. I think that mid-term, longer term, it will be great. On the short term, it's still Japan and I'm not expecting that suddenly the conservativeness level and the adoption rate will become exponential. So I would take it as a great support to the quality of the product and a great step forward to be a significant player in Japan, but I wouldn't, in our assumptions, the big effect won’t come in 2018. That’s to be completely honest.\nOperator: And we’ll go next to Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank.\nVishal Shah: So, a couple of questions. So maybe Ronen, Guy, have you seen any impact at all from the recent [indiscernible] especially in the C\u0026I market and what percentage of your 2018 shipments you think will be C\u0026I. You’ve said in the past up to 50% could be C\u0026I. Do you think that’s still the case?\nGuy Sella: So we don’t yet see the effect of the change in model prices in the US. But if you look at it, the effect, it will come, in my humble opinion, will affect Q3, maybe a little bit Q2 as you know, channels, both quite a lot of modules in Q3 and 4 of last year and as you know, the average lead time between closing a contract in the US to installation is according to what I’m aware of, maybe you have a little bit different numbers, is 12 to 16 weeks. So I think that we won't see effect of modules in Q1 and in probably also Q2, I think the effect, if will come, will come in Q2 and Q3 and what will be the effect on the Excel spreadsheet. If you put the additional cost of modules on the total cost of installation of presidential and commercial, I think this completely -- this one changed the Excel in a significant enough way to change the market behavior, but we saw in the past that the market in general and US in particular at the end of 2015, can take these changes in a way more severely emotionally than what we see in the Excel. So I wouldn't put myself in the position to estimate or guess what will be the total effect from Q3 and Q4 2018. I'm sure that in the mid to long-term, it wants to make bigger effect, big effect. Regarding, I think the second question Vishal was regarding the percentage of commercial. That's correct. Vishal, so I think we assured this in the past and that's why I mentioned also that's also why I mentioned that we might see differences on ASP erosion between commercial and residential. We would like to get on a megawatt basis by the end of the year to 50-50 percent between commercial and residential. And I believe and hope we’re in the right direction to get it. We are gaining fewer percentage, every – 1%, 2% every quarter, plus the effect of the new Jupiter configuration that will allow you to install 100-kilowatt in one installation. I think that’s supposed to get us to this point.\nVishal Shah: I just want to clarify, Ronen, the 7.5% to 10% ASP erosion outlook that you mentioned, that's not factored into Q1, right? You're not starting to lower price yet. It's just something that you expect to see maybe in the second half of the year. Is that right?\nRonen Faier: So again, in general, this is a working assumption. We do not see right now anything in the competitive environment that should change it, but in general we believe that, as Guy mentioned, the changes that we’ll do on the prices will be all through the year and whatever is already taken into account in to Q1 is already reflected in our stable gross margin expectation.\nVishal Shah: One last question, Guy, if you look at your competitor, Huawei, they launched a product in the European market in middle of last year. What kind of impact have you seen on your market share in the European market? I mean, it looks like you guys have gained market share despite a product launch. So what kind of feedback are you getting from the customers on that product launch?\nGuy Sella: So we just gained market share in Europe. So I would love to tell you that despite the fact that they released the product in Europe by mid last year, we managed to gain more market share, but honestly I think that they just launched a product in Australia a month ago and it's not yet really available in Europe. I do believe that despite the fact that it will be available in Europe probably sometime in end of Q1 or Q2, I'm quite confident we’ll be able to gain more and more market share. The product they’re now releasing is a product that does not have communication between optimizers and inverter and therefore do not have safety and/or monitoring. So it's a pretty crippled solution at the higher prices than what we sell. So I'm not expecting to be impacted in the next two, three, four quarters, but we take them very seriously and we are preparing ourselves for any type of slight competition as we do every year with many other good competitors such as SMA, et cetera.\nOperator: We’ll go next to Edwin Mok, Needham and Company.\nEdwin Mok: So just kind of wanted to talk about Ronen in terms of that partnership, do you expect to start shipping to that within this quarter or is that, a lot of it growth drivers over the current quarter?\nGuy Sella: So it's also in their press release, but the launch of the product from their perspective is March 2018. So probably, we’ll start to see shipments in Q2, but again I just want to -- people won’t take it out of the perspective. The Japanese market is a very conservative market and of course that with Omron, SolarEdge solution have kind of a cautious stamp on it, but it will take time. I'm not expecting exponential growth in Japan, so please do not take it out of proportion that it won’t influence long term. Short term model in the wrong way. I do believe that in mid, longer time perspective of two, three years, it will allow us to become very significant player also in Japan.\nEdwin Mok: And then Ronen, on the OpEx, sorry if you talked about it, how do you kind of think about OpEx for this quarter and for the remainder of the year.\nRonen Faier: So in general, the operating expenses and I think that we said it along the script, we have today a very nice situation. We are very profitable, we're growing and we see a situation where while we are increasing our, I would call it financial strength, some of our competitors are either decreasing it or even or -- or being stagnant and that actually gives us a golden opportunity to invest a lot in R\u0026D, to invest in new geography. And as such, I expect R\u0026D to continue and grow throughout the year. This is one place that we will not put a limitation as long as there are good ideas and good things that we can develop and there are so many of those. I think that the thing that will limit us on R\u0026D will be mostly the natural rate of how many people can you recruit, can you train and can you make sure that are becoming useful employees. And on sales and marketing, this will mostly be a growth that we will do in the new geographies, mostly in Asia Pacific, but also strengthening the areas in which we operate. The only place where we do not expect major growth is actually on the G\u0026A, where in G\u0026A, we believe that currently the cost structure is relatively sufficient.\nEdwin Mok: Third question I have is on the manufacturing side, or you guys have, firstly talk about order of manufacturing lines that you got to build the line. Where do you stand in terms of transitioning that automation and are you in a process or starting to looking to do that for the HD-wave inverters as well?\nGuy Sella: Yes. So, today, we have capacity, automatic line capacity for approximately 80% -- 70%, 80% of our optimizers. We ordered more automatic lines as we, the bigger you get, it takes longer lead time to increase volumes. So increasing volume from 100K units of optimizer a quarter to 200 is much, much easier than to increase from 2 million to 4 million. So we are in the process, we ordered quite a lot of automatic lines for the growth we're expecting in 2018, 2019. And we are in the process of designing automatic line for the HD-wave and in general, we -- our view is that in three to four years, we will get to the level that once we finish the development of a product, at the same time, we will finish the development of automatic assembly line. So from the day one of the product, in most cases, of course, not for very, very big inverters, but for, let's say product in the weight of -- physical weight of a pound to something in the range of maybe 100 pounds, we'll be able to finish the automatic assembly lines with the development of the product. Pretty much like automotive companies in general.\nOperator: We’ll next go to Chip Moore with Canaccord.\nChip Moore: Thanks. Maybe just a follow up to that. Outside of the component shortages, are you seeing any impact from inflationary pressures at all or are you confident that those manufacturing optimization efforts can more than offset that.\nGuy Sella: We don't -- we have good control on manufacturing capacity on test production, et cetera. So I'm not expecting -- to put it in proportion, it's very hard. It took a big portion of our management focus in 2017 to increase production volumes and I'm not expecting that something will become easier in 2018, but to increase the total manufacturing capacity, once you have secured enough components and you have good enough component inventory, which we’re building, I think this is completely doable. I don't think this is one of the major risks we see for 2018.\nChip Moore: Great. And maybe one more, you talked about having some more flexibility with repatriation of cash. Does that change your thinking at all? Strategically, how do you think about that?\nRonen Faier: So again strategically, we look at the corporate level. The one thing that did happen from the tax reform again, other than the tax that will be paid is the fact that now because of the fact that there is no real taxation on the repatriation of new profits earned outside of the United States, we have a little bit more flexibility and therefore we can better utilize the cash, but we do not expect this matter of fact to change dramatically our strategic decisions.\nOperator: And we’ll next go to Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer.\nColin Rusch: Guys, thanks for the comments on R\u0026D. You've got an awful lot of cash on the balance sheet right now. Can you talk a little bit about how you're going to deploy that cash in the areas in R\u0026D portfolio where we're really focused here in 2018?\nGuy Sella: So of course, we cannot reveal the R\u0026D plan for 2018, but I think you can see from the past, we are working extensively on growing the range of three phase inverters in order to reach very high sizes. None of these will happen over one year. Those are developments that spread over 18 to 30 months programs, but we have projects running of almost any size of inverter. We keep developing ASICs to control more and more of the black component, the ASIC component in our product. We are investing heavily in next generation and generation after next of optimizers. We started to develop our own automatic assembly line at another area and I think that not in 2018, but we believe we’ll come with a next generation of storage product, which will be a step ahead of what you can find today in the market.\nColin Rusch: And then can you talk about your decision making around balancing price and market share gains at this point and how you're making those decisions on a geographic basis?\nGuy Sella: It's not an algorithm to try and buy a computer. It's lots of judgment involved. We have very strong general managers in each of the geography. We are right working, the market in India is of course different from the market in Europe. Once you come to commercial market and residential is different in the US and Japan. So there is no one algorithm that is working here. What we have is the general, let’s say, general understanding that 37% gross margin at this point in the evolution of PV industry, at this point of our company efficiency where we are very effective in transferring close to 20% to non-GAAP profitability. We feel that above this point again, at this point, it’s worth to increase market share and we do it in strategic way where we analyzed at the level of Ronen and myself, Senior Global VP of Sales and the general manager that are very talented and have lots of experience in the market and with us in which geography, this will have higher effect and that's how we control the pricing level, that’s in one hand. On the other hand, we try not to open too big of a gap between different geographies once they're using exactly the same product. As you probably know, it might be looking at the same product, but due to safety and request for different cause, it might be quite some difference in bigger inverters and also residential regarding the cost of the product when it fits the US or Europe. So it's kind of a judgment call based on the fact that we want to increase market share. We filled it for the coming period, 37% gross margin is a good target and we prefer to use the extra cost reduced benefits in order to gain market share.\nOperator: And we’ll go next to Carter Driscoll, B. Riley FBR.\nCarter Driscoll: First off, Guy, I hope you're feeling well physically. First question is really around the R\u0026D spend. Could you at least give us an idea of what you were planning to spend in 2018 in solar versus adjacent products, on a dollar percentage basis?\nGuy Sella: Honestly, I don’t know the split between adjacent products and what we do today. So, you caught me on this one, but I would, in a rough number, when I look at the amount of teams that are developing products that you’re currently selling and teams that are developing products that we are currently not selling, I think that around 33% of the teens are working on products that we're currently not selling. I cannot promise you that that's exactly the split of the cost, because areas like AC can embed a software, et cetera, servicing all those teams. So it will be hard to estimate what exactly the ratio.\nCarter Driscoll: And then just as a follow up, adjacently, you obviously were handful with resi and C\u0026I and fulfilling all the outstanding demand, but you have at least talked about in the past plans to go after the utility scale. Has the changes in the module side at all affected those plans and/or timing?\nGuy Sella: No. It’s just that we -- as mentioned, I think that dollar wise, the total segment of utilities, around a third of the market, if you want to round it up and currently, we do have large installation, but we're definitely not a utility level player and that's definitely something that we’re working on and we'll come to the market with a product that will feed different sizes of modules, different type of technologies in MLP, input voltage in some aspects is more influencing on the technology than the total capacity of the module and you need to cover very well some of the thin film technologies that are going to very high voltages today. We're working on all those fronts, but again, just not to ruin the modules, models, the financial model going forward, none of those will be available in 2018. So those are the programs that I mentioned that development takes much longer than 18 months.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll next go to Joseph Osha, JMP Securities.\nJoseph Osha: Just a couple. First, if I listen to what you said about how you're handling component shortages and the timing of working through that, it would suggest that you probably got more room in the second half of the year, in the first half of the year to start to give some of that pricing back to your customers. Is that -- obviously you've talked about your pricing assumption being steady over the course of the year, but is that a fair conclusion.\nGuy Sella: I'm not sure it's coming from component shortages. I think it's coming from cost reduction, total cost reduction development, but in general I think [indiscernible] Q1, we are not expecting any major change in pricing that will influence the total model or on the yearly basis, we do expect seven or we plan to up to 7.5%, 10% ASP erosion that as I mentioned in the answer regarding market share, it will be pointed specifically to the right products in the right geographies. So, yes, the effect won’t be on Q1. We’ll see the effect probably more on Q2, 3 and 4. But I think that your assumption that the major effect is on the second part of the year is the right one.\nRonen Faier: And just one more thing, again not being effect on gross, and Joe, but one thing, effect not being, effect on gross margin, but rather the fact that again we expect to continue and maintain this 37%. So the effect is really the effect in the market, more than the effect on the gross margin itself.\nJoseph Osha: Right. That was what I was trying to say. I think you expressed it more effectively than I did. And then the second question, the sequential bump in inventories, is some of that perhaps representative of catching up a little bit on some of the component supply issues or is that just a normal operational thing given how quickly the business has grown?\nGuy Sella: The extra inventory we had by the end of 2017, that's what you mentioned.\nJoseph Osha: Yeah. You were up 20 million, so -- but obviously the top line was up as well. So –\nGuy Sella: Yeah. But the majority is finished goods, 20 million in comparison to 200 million and that's included inventory in transit, actually on ships from Europe and China to the US. So unfortunately, very tiny effect. In our model, we would like to have finished goods on hand in our third-party logistic centers in a much higher percentage of next quarter's sales in order to shorten lead time for our customers and in order to optimize shipping costs. So we are far unfortunately from the model that we operate in 2015, ‘16.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn things over to Guy Sella for any additional or closing remarks.\nGuy Sella: Thank you very much. In summary, our fourth quarter revenues were slightly above our guidance with record gross margins, profitability and cash generation. Our overall performance in 2017 was very strong in all financial parameters and we continue to grow our market share, while focusing on geographic and customer diversity, new and innovative products and healthy profitability coupled with cash generation. I'm sure that we can keep the same trajectory for 2018 and with this, I would like to thank you for joining us on today's call.\nOperator: And that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you all for joining us.
ATVI~2017~4~47~3300~2/9/2018~-.0054989974~-.013369555~.0029652~.051524047~-3.440609~-3.4633963~-3.7042215~-3.8579066~1~Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Activision Blizzard Q4 2017 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAmrita Ahuja: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard’s fourth quarter 2017 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Coddy Johnson, President and COO; and Spencer Neumann, CFO. And for Q\u0026A, Dennis Durkin, Chief Corporate Officer; Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King, will also join us. I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on information available to the Company as of the date of this presentation, and while we believe them to be true, they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. A number of things could cause the Company’s actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and those on the slide that is showing. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, February 8, 2018. We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. We provide non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings; restructuring charges and the associated tax benefits of these excluded items along with significant discreet tax related items such as those results from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures. There’s also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted to the website following the call. In addition, we will also be posting a financial overview, highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary sheet. Starting this quarter, we are introducing a new operating metric, net bookings. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period and is equal to revenues plus the impacts from deferrals. And now, I’d like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick.\nBobby Kotick: Thanks, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. This was a record quarter and record year for Activision Blizzard. We delivered record quarterly net bookings of $2.6 billion and record annual net bookings of $7.2 billion. We delivered record segment operating income of $2.4 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.21 per share, above our initial February outlook of $1.70. And we also delivered record annual operating cash flow of $2.2 billion. Each part of our business reached new milestones and demonstrated the durable and enduring nature of our franchises. Activision celebrated strong Call of Duty momentum and their best operating income year ever. Blizzard delivered their highest operating income ever for year with no major game releases. And King returned to growth with the Candy Crush franchise stronger than ever. 2017 was also an important year for us for preparation of our future growth initiatives. We invested in new services, features, content and experiences to connect and engage audiences all across our franchises. One example is the launch of the Overwatch League. Witnessing the passion of players at the opening matches of Blizzard Arena and the millions of spectators connecting via live stream from around the world was a thrilling moment in our history and a milestone in esports growth. Watching fans road trip across the country, spectators in the stands wearing team jerseys, gears in the game wearing team skins, audiences leaping to their feet after daily play and viewing parties around the world; these were awesome moments that created incredibly rewarding experience and demonstrated the emergence of professional competition as a way to celebrate our players. Launching a professional league is an ambitious undertaking and our teams executed on countless fronts, attracting 12 world-class team owners representing cities in Asia, Europe and North America, signing numerous league and team level sponsors, brining esports spectating and production values to new heights, and forming a media strategy that provides broad reach and fair value for our premium content while also preserving distribution on own platforms. Overwatch League matches are broadcast live on our MLG and Twitch, and will be available on other broadcast outlets throughout the world. In its first week, the league reached 10 million unique viewers and had more than 280,000 average viewers on a per minute basis, in the week since we’ve seen sustained levels of viewership globally with new spectators joining each week as the excitement continues to grow. Of course, we are building this league for the long term, and we’re pleased with the early strong momentum that we have which has created value for players, spectators, team owners, partners and sponsors. Our efforts have already led to increased global demand for expansion teams, which we expect to start selling later this year. We also believe in the growth potential of each new opportunity we are pursuing whether in-game advertising, consumer products, cinematic productions or esports, all of these support our communities and help to drive engagement with our franchises. Each new experience we provide that enables our players to demonstrate their passion, creates a virtuous cycle of engagement, investment and growth. It’s still early days for many of these efforts but making progress in these strategic growth areas will be an important focus for us in 2018 and beyond. I have the privilege to lead one of the best teams in the entire business world. And as I begin my 28th year at helm, I have never been more energized to pursue with focus and determination the great growth opportunities that lie ahead. Also, this quarter, we announced that Reveta Bowers joined our Board of Directors, Reveta brings an immense amount of experience and leadership from education and media institutions such as Common Sense Media where she chairs the National Board of Directors and from The Walt Disney Company where she served as a director for 10 years. We’re thrilled to have her as our newest Board member. And now, here is Coddy, to review the highlights of our operations this quarter.\nCoddy Johnson: Thank you, Bobby. Activision Blizzard had a record year. And throughout 2017, we broke records and posted strong results each quarter by providing an ongoing year-round scheme of content, services, features and events, both large and small, to our passionate and deeply engaged communities. While achieving these records, we also made important investments to drive future growth. We invested in marketing, to grow our franchise reach, and used services and features to enable more audience engagement and player investment and in new growth verticals to celebrate our fans. Let’s dive into our first strategic pillar, audience reach, which was 385 million monthly active users this quarter, up from 384 million in Q3. Starting with King. On our last call, we discussed a number of initiatives underway to stabilize King’s user base. Those ongoing efforts include releasing fresh and compelling features, events and content into the live games, ROI positive marketing to attract and engage new players, and a strong pipeline of new titles to expand the network. Several of these initiatives enabled King to finish Q4 with 290 million monthly active users and to grow time spent per user to a record of 37 minutes. The Candy Crush franchise in particular was up in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter, while also driving increased engagement with higher daily active users and higher time spent per player. Activision had the top grossing console game releases in North America and two of the top five worldwide, getting at 55 million monthly active users in Q4, up double digits quarter-over-quarter and matching the prior quarterly record. Call of Duty: World War II was the top grossing console game worldwide in 2017, making it the number one franchise globally, a spot that franchise has held for eight of the last nine years. Call of Duty: World War II also set a new franchise milestone with the biggest launch quarter sell-through on current-gen consoles, higher even than Black Ops III. The game also set a PlayStation record as the biggest day one digital release ever. We’ve seen a steady march upward effort on full game downloads for Call of Duty over the last several years, and there’s plenty of runway still ahead. All of this sound performance coupled with a great Black Ops III digital season earlier in the year, means that the most successful video game franchise over the last 20 years continues to be healthy and vibrant and will carry strong momentum into 2018. To that end, this fall, we plan to continue to exceed fans’ expectations with the new release from Activision’s Treyarch, the creators of Black Ops, the most successful sub-franchise in Call of Duty history, and we cannot wait to share more about that with you on future calls. Turning now to Destiny. Destiny 2 had an impressive launch, highly rated and second to Call of Duty as the highest grossing consoles in North America in 2017. It added a critically acclaimed PC version with distribution offered at Battle.net, [ph] and the attach rate of Destiny 2’s first expansion released in December was higher than that of Destiny 1. That said, we haven’t yet sustainably expanded Destiny community. The Bungie is hard at work improving the game. And the good news is that the Destiny community is a deeply committed, vocal passionate player base, as they responded [ph] in the past when we made improvements based on their sentiments. To that end, last week, Bungie released an update outlining what the changes we made and the changes that are coming. So far, these changes have been received positively and the team has a robust slate of services, features and seasonal events still to come. There are also two epic adventures on the horizon with expansion 2 in May and a major content launch later this year. There is magic in this franchise and we’re committed to meeting our own and our players’ expectations in the coming quarters. Crash Bandicoot continued to have strong sales in Q4 after a successful summer launch. Crash’s performance shows how valuable our library of IP can be, and brought back players in the compelling new way. We look forward to growing other beloved IP in future offerings as well. Blizzard is celebrating its 27th anniversary today. Happy birthday, Blizzard. A lot of things have changed over the past 27 years as the business has grown across genres, platforms and geographies but a few things have not including Blizzard’s commitment to put players first and to release games at an incredibly high level of quality. Blizzard finished the year with 40 million monthly active users, continuing a sixth quarter streak of 40 million monthly active users or more. Overwatch continued to attract new players in the most recent Blizzard World content and it’s been well received by the community. Overwatch’s model of delivering year-round content with seasonal events and new heroes and new maps continues to drive strong engagement. Hearthstone’s monthly active users increased year-over-year this quarter as players enjoyed the latest expansion, Kobolds and Catacombs and the introduction of new free content. While net bookings did not match the prior expansion’s record performance, players did log more play time, which brings me to our second strategic pillar, deepening the engagement. For Activision Blizzard and King overall, daily time spent per user was over 50 minutes for the second quarter in a row, placing us on par with Facebook’s time per day across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Now, that 50 minutes per day is just the time spent in our games; it does not include the growing popularity of watching our games on other online platforms. For the year, Activision Blizzard had seven of the top 20 games on Twitch; the next closest publisher had just two, demonstrating the broad esports appeal of our franchises. Bobby already shared that launching of the Overwatch League was a key milestone for us and that we’re seeing strong early momentum. And Call of Duty World League also opened its next season in December and is off to a good start selling out each of its World League Global Open events. And the season’s launch event more than doubled viewership hours over the prior year. Turning now to our third pillar, player engagement. In-game services, features and content continue to engage our fans and help drive our results, delivering a Q4 record of over $1 billion of in-game net bookings and an annual record of over $4 billion. We focus on offering compelling content for our communities wherever they play. Activision had some of the industry’s best selling downloadable content in 2017 including Zombies Chronicles for Call of Duty: Black Ops III which was been the number one add-on offering of the year for PlayStation North America. This is notable and impressive given that Chronicles came out nearly two years after Black Ops III launch and illustrates the value of releasing great content to our engaged communities wherever they are playing. Just as impressively, player investment in additional virtual goods and services surpassed investment in downloadable content in 2017 for Call of Duty and for Destiny, and we expect that to be the same for 2018. Activision has a great digital roadmap ahead including Destiny 2’s expansion pass and Call of Duty: World War II’s season pass. King was the biggest contributor to our record year of in-game net bookings. King continues to have two of the top-10 grossing games on U.S. iOS and Android app stores, a level of performance they delivered for over four years now. For the first time, King actually held both the number one and the number two spots at same time of Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga, respectively, demonstrating their remarkable durability in the Candy Crush franchise. Overall, King had an incredible year in 2017, delivering not only four straight quarters of growth in consumer spend on Candy Crush but also a new mobile net bookings record with their biggest year, their best quarter in Q3 and their best week ever in Q4. Finally, we continue to make progress on our Company-wide mobile pipeline. We are hard at work on initiatives across a number of our franchises. We plan to see some early results later this year, and for the bulk of our new mobile opportunities to be driving growth in 2019 and beyond. In summary, 2017 was our best year yet because of the broad-based success we delivered and because of the groundwork we laid to realize significant growth in years ahead. We have a great slate on the road, [ph] for 2018 and beyond. And we look forward to continuing to serve our passionate fans, communities, and audiences are the world. Spence will now review the 2017 numbers in more detail and discuss 2018 guidance. Spence?\nSpencer Neumann: Thanks, Coddy. So, today, I’ll our review our Q4 and 2017 results as well as our outlook for 2018. Q4 was another strong quarter capping off a record-setting year, with record quarterly and annual revenues driven by record annual digital revenues as our business is now 78% digital and record in-game revenues consistent with our entertainment as a service model. With an increasingly diversified business, we generated for the first time over $2 billion in annual revenues on each of three interactive platforms, console, PC, and mobile, and with record profits, record annual non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share, and record cash flows. Each of Activision Blizzard and King contributed to our over-performance for the year, delivering record annual total segment revenues and operating income. And as Bobby noted, this was without the benefit of a new full game release from Blizzard, underscoring the strength of our continuous engagement model. Activision had an impressive fourth quarter, capping off their best year ever with segment records for operating income of over $1 billion and operating margin of over 38%. Activision’s performance was driven primarily by the resurgence of the Call of Duty franchise with the successful launch of Call of Duty: World War II, as well as strong sales for Crash Bandicoot. Q4 segment revenues and operating income increased 16% and 32% over prior year respectively, with the full year growing at similarly strong rates. King had an outstanding year with revenue and operating income up 7% and 12%, respectively, on a pro forma basis that includes the 2016 pre-acquisition period for King. This is a major accomplishment. It’s testament to the strong execution of the King team, their increased prioritization on the Candy Crush franchise and other live titles, and their intense focus on leveraging their platform to drive continuous improvements in engagement, game features and player investment. While margins expanded year-over-year, we did see some compression in Q4 as King strategically invested in marketing live titles to profitably drive reach. Blizzard also delivered a $2.1 billion of revenue and $712 million of operating income. Blizzard generated record results for the year with no major game release, fueled by a steady stream of content and events across their franchises, in particular Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. Revenue, operating income and segment operating income margin were down year-over-year as expected given the difficult comps to last year’s World of Warcraft expansion and Overwatch release. We did see some incremental margin compression in Q4, primarily due to additional marketing initiatives. Nonetheless, with 33% full-year OI margins, the team did a nice job delivering the core business while investing in key growth initiatives across the Overwatch League, mobile incubation and MLG network. Now, before I turn to our consolidated results and 2018 guidance, a brief note on U.S. tax reform. Our 2017 GAAP results include incremental expense of $794 million due to the impact of significant discreet tax-related items, primarily related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December of 2017. The charge related to tax reform is a reasonable estimate but is preliminary and includes a onetime tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we expect a reduction in our future effected tax rate which we will reflect in our 2018 guidance. We’ll also now have repatriation opportunities for our international cash that enable more efficient global cash management and capital structure flexibility. So, now, let’s turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I’ll be referencing non-GAAP figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated record GAAP revenues of $2.04 billion, $343 million above our November guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of $597 million. As already mentioned, this quarter we are introducing a new operating metric, net bookings which were a record $2.64 billion. We had a GAAP loss per share of $0.77 including a $1.03 expense from the impact of the significant discreet tax-related items that I just mentioned. Adjusted to exclude these discreet tax related items, we would have delivered earnings per diluted share of $0.27, ahead of our guidance of $0.10. We had non-GAAP EPS of $0.49 in Q4, ahead of guidance of $0.36. And both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS figures include net deferrals of $0.45. For the year, we generated record GAAP revenues of $7.02 billion, as $1 billion above our initial 2017 guidance. This includes the net deferral of revenues of the $139 million. Net bookings were a record $7.16 billion. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.36, which includes $1.04 expense from the impact of discreet tax-related items in Q4. Excluding the discreet tax-related items, we would have delivered record GAAP EPS this year of $1.39, ahead of initial guidance last February of $0.72. We generated record non-GAAP EPS of $2.21, ahead of our initial guidance last February of $1.70. These figures include net deferrals of $0.07. So, now, looking at cash flow and capital structure. Our strong business performance for the year also delivered record annual operating cash flow of $2.21 billion and Q4 operating cash flow of $1.16 billion, finishing the year with approximately $4.8 billion in cash and investments. With regard to capital structure, we had positive development throughout the year and continue to take a balanced approach overall. In Q2, we received another upgrade from S\u0026P to BBB and entered into a leverage neutral $1.2 billion refinancing that locked-in attractive long-term interest rates. We paid down $500 million in debt and finished the year with approximately $4.44 billion of aggregate debt outstanding, and we increased our annual dividend 15% to $0.30, paying out $226 million to shareholders in May. Now, we are heading into 2018 with the strong balance sheet and additional flexibility. We ended the year with a net cash position of $335 million. And as discussed, the recent tax reform allows us to repatriate the cash we’re holding overseas, more efficiently. This year, we’ll once again take a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our Board has authorized a 13% increase in our dividend to $0.34 per share, payable in May, and further debt pay down of over $1 billion. In addition, our $1 billion stock repurchase authorization remains in effect for another year. Now, let’s turn to our outlook for 2018, but before doing so -- before I review the numbers, I wanted to quickly discuss ASC 606 and its impact on our guidance. While ASC 606 will affect our GAAP revenue recognition, it’s not expected to materially impact our annual segment results, cash flows or financial performance, as reviewed for internal management purposes. We do expect that there’ll be some quarterly movements within the year. So, please refer to the investor FAQ we’ve provided on our website for more information on ASC 606. Now, turning to our 2018 slate. From an operating income perspective, we expect each of our segment to grow in 2018. While we also continue invest in new releases, mobile pipeline and our future growth initiatives including advertising, esports leagues and MLG network. We expect in-game revenues to be a primary driver of our growth for both the top and bottom line. Coming off a record year in 2017, we expect in-game net bookings to grow by a double-digit percentage in 2018 as we continue to innovate and deliver more engaging content to our players. Now, given the timing of launches in 2018 and the continued ramp of our new initiatives, we expect our performance to be further weighted to the back half of the year relative to what we saw in 2017. We expect Blizzard to grow year-over-year with the release of World of Warcraft’s Battle for Azeroth this summer. I am glad to say the presales for Azeroth kicked off last week and are off to an encouraging start. In addition, Blizzard has exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content across franchises, including Hearthstone’s three expansions in 2018 and Overwatch’s in-game events. Blizzard will also start to see the benefit of its investment initiatives, as we expect the Overwatch League to be profitable in 2018, its first full year of operations. We expect Activision to grow modestly year-over-year, driven primarily by Call of Duty’s digital season of content and the exciting new release planned for Q4. As Coddy mentioned, Activision and Bungie are hard at work on Destiny 2 to improve the in-game engagement through regular updates and events, which we anticipate will benefit performance later this year with the release of a new expansion in May and a major expansion in the second half of the year. And we expect King to be up year-over-year, driven by ongoing live operations across the portfolio, and two or more new releases during the year including social casino. As we’ve indicated on prior calls, we’ll begin to ramp our ad business in 2018. We expect the minor positive profit contribution weighted towards the back half of the year as we continue to roll out additional video ad products, methodically develop capabilities and infrastructure, and build the business for the significant opportunity that we see over the long term. Now, turning to numbers for guidance. On a GAAP basis, for 2018, we expect revenues of $7.35 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $100 million. We expect record net bookings of $7.45 billion. We expect product costs of 22%, operating expenses of 53%. Our GAAP net interest expense is expected to be $136 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20%. We expect 776 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.78. For 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 44%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $95 million and we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20%. We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $2.45, including a GAAP deferral of $0.05. Now, let’s turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.82 billion including GAAP deferrals of negative $540 million. We expect net bookings of $1.28 billion, growing year-over-year. We expect product costs of 20%, operating expenses of 53%, and our GAAP net interest expense is expected to be $30 million, our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20%. We expect 771 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.47. For Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 20%, operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $29 million, a tax rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.34. In closing, in 2017, our inspired teams across Activision, Blizzard and King demonstrated the enduring nature of our franchises. We believe the combination of leading owned IP and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content capabilities and creative excellence, geographic platform and business model diversity, and continued fiscal disciplined, focus and business prioritization provide an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance, driving meaningful growth in 2018 and beyond. Now, I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, Riccardo and Dennis as they join us for the Q\u0026A portion of the call. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Merwin: So, this one is for Riccardo. We’ve seen some pretty impressive growth for King, lately. You’ve invested in some more frequent content updates and we’ve seen improved player engagement as a result. But beyond, I guess, the improvements and monetization for King, can you talk a bit more about the pipeline and the two or more new releases in 2018 that you mentioned in the prepared remarks?\nRiccardo Zacconi: So, we have several teams working on new games, first of all. And those are games using the existing franchise IP as well as new IP. So, we are creating also new IP. And these games are at various stages of production, and it’s a multiyear pipeline. So, as you heard before, in 2018, we plan to release at least two new games including social casino in partnership with PlayStudios. I would like to highlight that we set ourselves a very high bar for new game launches. We will only launch games of the highest quality and we’ll only launch them when they’re ready. When we think about games pipeline, it’s not just about new games, it’s also new content for our existing live games where we develop new features and live ops. In 2017, we focused this development on increasing engagement and increasing monetization, and this has allowed us to hit several mobile bookings milestones. As you heard earlier, we had in Q3, our highest-ever mobile bookings quarter, and in Q4, we hit our highest ever mobile booking week. In 2018, we will continue focusing on engagement and monetization, but we will also focus these new features on rich initiatives. So, we expect to continue to drive positive engagement and monetization as well as we expect to attract new users. So, if I think about it, we exited 2017 with a strong momentum. And I believe that we have a great pipeline, both of new titles and new content for our live games.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Laura Martin with Needham.\nLaura Martin: Let’s talk about the Overwatch League. It sounds like everything is going great. Could you sort of give us an update on how it did benchmark against your expectations and what surprised you, both on the upside and downside? And then, on the monetization, as we’re modeling 2018, you said you’re going to sell more teams. Could you talk about monetization generally and then where do you think the teams will sell for more than the first 12 teams?\nMike Morhaime: This Mike from Blizzard. First off, I want to take a moment to thank everyone on the Overwatch League team for the amazing job they’ve done. Overwatch League was an ambitious undertaking, it required supported collaboration across Activision Blizzard starting from the Overwatch game team although up to Bobby who as you know has been a strong supporter of the league from the beginning, as well as from a host of stakeholders and the communities. I want to especially thank all the pro players who compete, the team owners who really got behind our vision for the league, our partners over at Twitch and our sponsors who believed in what we were building. I want to also thank the viewers who tune in especially those people who are coming to the studio and bringing their passion and energy and filling up the stands. They’re an inspiration to everyone who works on Overwatch League. It’s really been wonderful to see how everything has worked out so far. We’re very pleased with the high-quality that we have been able to enjoy every week. The games have been exciting to watch and the reception from our viewers has been really spectacular. So, so far everything has either met or exceeded our expectations. We made a landmark two-year media rights deal with Twitch and more than 10 million people tuned in to week one, worldwide. We had an impressive audience per minute of over 400,000 on opening day. We’ve also been very happy that several major brands have partnered with Overwatch League including Intel, HP, Toyota, T-Mobile, and Sour Patch Kids. While we’re pleased, it’s important to note that this is only the beginning. Our focus is going to be on continued growth of the audience through improvements to the broadcast and the live viewer experience. In the mid to long term, we think the audience growth is the key to seeing impact both to the bottom line results and to the Company as a whole, and I think also to drive popularity in the game as well. In terms of selling expansion teams, we are very excited with the reaction and the interest in expansion teams. I’m pretty confident to say that the price is going to go up.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe one for Eric on Destiny 2. Can you kind of give us little more color just on the trends you are seeing around player engagements, in-game monetization, and then, again, little more color just about how you are thinking about the game and the plans for 2018?\nEric Hirshberg: Yes, absolutely, Matt. Happy to talk about Destiny 2. And I want to start just by putting it all in context because we did have a very successful launch of the game. As Coddy mentioned, it was the number two game in North America, the number four game globally, and it was also very well received, it had an A7 rating, that was the full 10 points of improvement over Destiny 1 and it received a 120 awards and nominations. And on top of that we saw a very positive sentiment and new franchise high levels of engagement for the first couple of months post launch. Now after that meaning after players report a significant amount of hours already into the game, we have definitely seen some real sentiment issues surface in a couple of areas, and we got plans to address those. For example, one of the things we wanted to do with Destiny 2 was to make the game a little bit less of a grind based on feedback we heard and we also wanted to provide players with more direct pass to getting the game’s best rewards. And that actually allowed our core players to consume the content faster than we anticipated. And that has led to an increase in players calling for more challenges and better rewards in the ongoing game. Now, this is a live game, and responding to player feedback is a part of the process in this game and any live game. And we feel we have the right plans in place to address the concern. Last week, Bungie posted a detailed roadmap of the changes that we have coming over the next several months. And thus far, those plans have been very well received as have the changes that we’ve already put into the game itself already and the sentiment is already starting to shift. And also, remember that we have a great expansion coming in May and a major expansion coming at the end of the year. And those events have always been opportunities for us to reengage our community and win back people who have churned out. This is an incredibly passionate group of players and that passion is a good thing, even when the sentiment is critical because it shows how deeply people care about the game. And we think that’s one of the thing that makes us a great franchise. And we are fully committed to listening to and communicating with our community more frequently and more transparently than ever and making the right changes to improve the experience. And we think we have the right path forward.\nOperator: We’ll take our next question from Tim O’Shea with Jefferies.\nTimO’Shea: So, Coddy touched on this in the opening remarks, but I wanted to get a better sense for where Call of Duty finished the year in terms of full game downloads. And then, maybe if you could give us little color on what your expectations are going forward?\nSpencer Neumann: See, as you’ll recall, I mentioned last quarter that we’re seeing a consumer-led shift to full game downloads in our console business. It’s similar to what we’ve already experienced in the games business on PC platforms, and of course digital transition is not unique to gaming; it’s impacting pretty much every form of entertainment consumption. So, the good news for us is, as I also discussed last call that it’s good for our business; it brings us closer to our consumer and with better economics. So, with that context, Call of Duty finished the year at 30% digital mix. And we mentioned last year that our digital mix was about 20% to 25% on Call of Duty. So, this year’s performance -- it’s essentially in line actually, a bit of an acceleration in that historical 5 percentage-point increase we’ve been seeing the past few years. And I should underscore that these are big absolute numbers, when we’re talking about Call of Duty because it’s such a mass market game. As Coddy mentioned, Call of Duty: World War II is the biggest day one digital release ever of PlayStation, and in aggregate, it represented the biggest Activision digital title ever released on console. As we look forward, Tim, we’d expect the mix shift in 2018 to be similar to what we saw for Call of Duty this year. It obviously a bit tough to predict with certainty given that it’s ultimately consumer-driven but I know there’re teams that are -- they’re going to continue to innovate with compelling digital offers and other strategies that deliver value to the community and will also continue to support our important retail partners. So, overall, the trends remain strong and they’re positive for our business and the good news is we got quite a bit of runway ahead of us.\nOperator: Up next, we have Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMike Olson: I just have one. You talked about the opportunity for the actual league. But, could you talk about the Overwatch League impact on Overwatch, the game itself, as it relates to engagement, monetization and/or core game sales?\nMike Morhaime: The Overwatch League has increased overall engagement with the franchise, between viewership and game play. When you consider the hundreds of thousands of fans watching each match and average watch time of over an hour each night, we’re tapping into a whole new avenue for players to express their passion for Overwatch. Of course, there are other positives for the game overall. The Overwatch League has driven a ton of buzz and awareness for the game. And so as that increases, our players have new ways to customize their playing experience with in-game digital skins as well as physical merchandise. And we’ve seen our players respond well to both of those. We’re also looking forward to launching additional initiatives to tie the viewing experience better with the play experience. We think that over the long term, the league will bring in new players as people see the excitement around the league and may even start to train to become the next pro player. Outside of league, we have additional plans to keep Overwatch fresh and players engaged. We already released a new map called Blizzard World in January. We have the Lunar New Year event launching today and there’s additional plans later this year for new heroes and seasonal events to come out. That’s all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrandon Hoffman: Hi. This is Brandon Hoffman on for Brian Nowak. So, you had strong performance from Call of Duty: World War II and there’s excitement about digital in 2018. Can you talk a bit about the CoD pipeline forward?\nBobby Kotick: Absolutely, the CoD pipeline is one of my favorite topics. Before we talk about World War II, I think it’s worth stepping back and talking about how pleased we’re with the Call of Duty franchise overall. Obviously, Call of Duty: World War II was the number one console video game in the world in 2017 and that makes Call of Duty the number one franchise in world eight of the last nine years and the Call of Duty: World War II also delivered the biggest launch quarter we’ve seen on current generation console, even higher than Black Ops III as I think Coddy mentioned. And engagement on World War II has also been strong, not quite as strong we’ve seen from the Black Ops franchise which of course has been our stickiest games but we have seen strong participation with our first two seasonal events, the Winter Siege and the Resistance. And we have actually a more robust calendar of those types of events in the game than we’ve ever had before. So, our strategy of bringing Call of Duty content to whatever game our fans are choosing to play is really continuing to pay off because also in 2017 we saw that in Black Ops III, the Zombies Chronicles piece was the number one top selling add-on content on PlayStation last year which is more remarkable given that it was released almost few years after the launch of the original game. So that of course sets the stage for the game we have planned later this year which is being developed by our team at Treyarch. Now, as you know, they have developed some of our most successful games ever. And they’ve proven time and again that they know how to keep our players engaged for the long haul. So, overall, I would say our strategy for Call of Duty is working. World War II is a blockbuster; we’ve got a thriving Black Ops community who is excited for the upcoming Treyarch developed game. And I honestly really wish I could say more about what we have in the pipeline because I’m so excited about it but suffice it say. I think we have the best three-year slate in Call of Duty’s history which is really staying something given this franchise’s history. And I think we’ve got multiple different game universes that we know our players love on tap. So, obviously more to come on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan: I wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of the moves you’ve made, whether it would be investments, acquisitions to position the Company for the advertising opportunity across King. And then, maybe the second one would be how do you think about extending those capabilities or assets across other brands or platforms of the Company in the coming years?\nRiccardo Zacconi: Advertising for us is a strategic focus given the opportunity we have with our large and engaged audience. So, we are prioritizing investments across multiple areas. First of all, we are building a world-class team and we are investing in our teams on several dimensions on the ad product, in engineering, in sales and in analytics. And we have already people in place. And this year, we plan to scale these teams further. Second, we are investing in creating great ad products. And by that I mean ad experiences that resonate with our highly engaged players and that are well-integrated into the game play, and also deliver real value to our advertisers. So, to get these right, we have embedded the X [ph] teams within our game teams including in Candy. So, third, we are investing in our own ad tech infrastructure. In 2017, we’ve seen early success with a dozen of global brands buying advertising across a number of territories in five different games. And we have seen repeat buys as a result of the strong completion and viability metrics. In 2018, as you heard Spence earlier, we’re expecting only a modest bottom line contribution from ads as we plan to ramp individual ads opportunity, and as we continue to invest in the significant opportunity for the long term. For the second part of the question, I will hand over to Coddy.\nCoddy Johnson: I think first, just to step back, and you know that we have several key initiatives underway. We’re building our capability in one area of the business, enables flexibility and option value to bring that capability to other areas of the business over time. Overwatch League could be a great example of this. So, the focus now is completely and solely on Overwatch success. But over time, the professional city-based league approach, infrastructure, the knowhow, the team, the processes, the support structure could logically go on to support other franchises that have strong esports momentum. And broadly, the way to think about this, Eric, advertising we think is another good example of this. And perhaps specifically, we have the opportunity probably in a couple of areas that are impacting. The first and foremost one is the opportunity that Riccardo just spoke to. Ads for the key mobile network is our primary focus right now. It’s the first step in building our internal ad products, tech deck, team and infrastructure. The second, we do have a near-term opportunity to bring relevant advertising to our esports audiences. We are already off to a good start there with Overwatch League, media rights, sponsorships, advertiser interest, but we see further opportunity in our owned MLG platform. And over time, third, there could be opportunities in other areas of the Company, particularly as we explore ad-based experiences across new games that are suited to that form of media. If you then just step a little bit back, we have over 50 minutes of engagement per day in our games right now, and that’s not yet including all the time spent watching games in our franchises. So, we think there’s a pretty compelling opportunity to do what you said, which is to be able to bring advertising to other brands and platforms across our network.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc.\nEvan Wingren: This is for Mike. Just wondering, what are your expectations for World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth in terms of the size, engagement or any other innovation in the game for this expansion?\nMike Morhaime: So, at Blizzard, we always get excited about new launches. And we in addition to our players are very excited about Battle for Azeroth’s features, which include new Allied Races, to give players even more character customization options, players who preordered the expansion have been enjoying early access to some of the Allied Races already, and that has helped drive early preorders. We’re very pleased with the results so far. Battle for Azeroth also includes two huge continents for players to explore as well as some new game play modes. Warfronts is a new cooperative mode where players will band together in massive battles inspired by Warcraft’s RTS roots. And the Island Expeditions mode will include randomized elements for small groups to enjoy with great replayability which is very important in the game like Global Warcraft. Content always drives engagement. So, just like we did with Legion, we are planning a steady stream of content after launch to maintain engagement. As for what’s ahead in 2018 with Battle for Azeroth, we’re looking forward to sharing more in the months to come and releasing expansion this summer. There’s a ton of buzz right now in the community and at Blizzard. The team is very excited about this expansion.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I guess, I just wanted some clarification on where development stands for some of the new mobile titles in the pipeline, not only in King, which I think was already addressed but across Blizzard and Activision following up on some of the announcements on personal, last year perhaps.\nCoddy Johnson: So, you are right. I’d probably break them, mobile efforts and new games into two buckets. The first you mentioned which is the ongoing efforts at King on their mobile pipeline. It’s just worth highlighting and they’re taking a very focused approach to development. And as mentioned, expect to have two or more new releases during the year, in addition to the ongoing updates inside their existing live games, which really are just in the live games initiatives in and of themselves that drive new players and bring in new audiences. So, there is as you know and as we speak to a lot, there is real focus there. But the second opportunity is to take our very successful PC and console franchises and extend them to mobile. And we think this is the time to do it and it’s an exciting opportunity for few reasons. First, mobile gaming is of course not very much at scale, large and growing with billions of people around the world who essentially have a mini console or PC in a pocket. And kind of the second reason that the technology we feel has advanced to a point where we feel the mobile platform now that can fulfill the requirements of our core IP. There is also for us we think a really important opportunity in Asia where we already have some of the most successful non-mobile franchises. And as you know, many of the top mobile games there now are based on existing console or PC IP. That was their roots in console and PC and they moved to mobile. And we think there is an opportunity for us as well over time to explore our IP on mobile in that region. We obviously want to get this right, we want to do it well at super high quality for our players and audiences who matter a great deal to us. So, it takes the investment and time. But we do plan to see some early results there this year from our mobile investments and we expect more meaningful impact in 2019 and beyond. So, we’re working hard in the pipeline and we will let more news to share down the road.\nBobby Kotick: Okay. I think that was the last question. Right? So, well, thank you all for joining the call today. We appreciate it. We appreciate your time. And we look forward to seeing or speaking with you -- and speaking with you over the next few weeks and months. Thanks.\nOperator: And that does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.
EFX~2021~1~154~4110~4/22/2021~.19491883~.21048422~.25165308~.29523438~-4.8178382~-4.6004419~-4.4432111~-4.4594717~1~Operator: Good day and welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nDorian Hare: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today’s conference call. I’m Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.\nMark Begor: Thanks Dorian. Before I address Equifax's very strong first quarter results, I want to again thank our 11,000 employees and families that supported them for the tremendous dedication they continue to show under the challenging COVID environment over the past year. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope that you and those close to you remain safe. Turning to slide four and as I will cover in a moment, Equifax delivered an outstanding first quarter with record revenue and strong sequential growth versus fourth quarter. The tremendous progress we have made executing against our strategic priorities and building out our Equifax cloud capabilities is allowing us to outperform our underlying markets and deliver outstanding revenue growth and margin expansion. In the US where the economy is still recovering from the COVID pandemic more rapidly than we anticipated, we continue to outperform the overall mortgage market, which remains strong in the first quarter. We're also seeing a real recovery and strong growth across our core banking, auto, insurance, government, and talent business segments. We delivered growth again in the first quarter internationally with continued challenging COVID restrictions in place in most of our global markets and we expect to see acceleration in this growth as economies recover outside the US.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark referenced earlier, US mortgage market inquiries remained very strong in 1Q '21 and up 21%, but that growth was slightly lower than the 24% we had expected when we provided guidance in early February. As shown on the left side of Slide 10, as mortgage rates increased over the past few months and refinancing activity continues, the number of US mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing has declined to about $30 million. Although still very strong by historic standards, this is down from the levels we saw in 4Q '20 and early 1Q 2021. Based upon our most recent data from 4Q 2020, mortgage refinancings were continuing at about $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of slide 10, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022. Based on these trends and specifically, the reduction in the pool of mortgages that would benefit from refinancing, we are reducing our expectation for the mortgage market financing activity in 2021. As shown on slide 11, we now expect mortgage credit inquiries to be about flat in 2Q 2021 versus 2Q 2020 and to be down about 25% in the second half of 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. Overall, for 2021, we expect mortgage market credit inquiries to be down approximately 8%. This compares to the down approximately 5% we discussed with you in February. Slide 12 provides our guidance for 2Q 2021. We expect revenue in the revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 16% to 18% including a 2.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 2%. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2021 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.63 per share. In 2Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $44 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 2Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share, up 15% to 21% from 2Q 2020. This performance is being delivered in the context of the US mortgage market, which is expected to be flat versus 2Q 2020. Slide 13 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially despite the expectation of a weaker US mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.575 billion and $4.675 billion reflects revenue growth of about 11% to 13% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.7%. EWS is expected to deliver over 20% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in verification services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid to high single-digit driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in the upper single-digits, and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single-digits in 2021. 2Q 2021 revenue was also expected to be down mid-single-digits for DCS. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by $0.91 per share. This is consistent with our guidance for 2021 that we gave in February. 2021 adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $7.05 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is down approximately 3% to up 1% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation costs of $0.91 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021, which show growth of about 10% to 14% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of over $65 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.40 a share. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance are provided -- will be provided in the 1Q, '21 earnings slide deck to be posted later this morning. Slide 14 provides a view of Equifax Total and core revenue growth from 2019 through 2021. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market on Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims business within our EWS employer services business, and also the employee retention credit revenue from our recently acquired HIREtech business. Employee retention credits are specific US government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 2Q, '21 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of guidance ranges we provided. In 1Q, '21, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and expect to continue to deliver strong core revenue growth in 2Q, '21 of about 20% and 16% for all of 2021. This very strong performance, we believe, positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now I'd like to hand it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. This highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a critical component of our next chapter of growth as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth. We continue to focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel topline growth. In the first quarter, we delivered 39 new products, which is up from the 35 we delivered last year. We're encouraged by this continued strong performance, especially following the record 135 new products we delivered last year. We wanted to highlight some of these new products, which we expect to drive revenue in '21 and beyond. First, Insight Score for credit card launched by USIS provides the credit card industry with a specific credit risk score created using credit and alternative data that predicts the likelihood of a consumer becoming 90 days past due or more within 24 months of origination. USIS also launched a new commercial real estate tenant risk assessment product suite, which provides real-time and unmatched data analytics and risk assessment for tenants, buildings and portfolio strength, delivered through an interactive, ignite marketplace app or as a stand-alone report. And Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of products focused on the government vertical. Their government enhanced solutions, social services verification product gives the ability for the customer to choose desired period of employment history with options ranging from 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years or the full employment history. These products help government agencies quickly and efficiently administer federally – federal supplement -- supplementary nutrition, child health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare benefits, managed child support and insurance program integrity. In the first quarter, over 2/3 of our new products launched or in development leveraged our new Equifax cloud-based global product platforms. This enables significant synergies and efficiencies in how we build the new products, our speed to bring the products to market and our ability to move the new products easily to our global markets. Our new cloud-based Luminate platform for fraud management is a great example, which is launching in Canada and the US simultaneously and will soon launch in the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. This would have taken much longer and been much more expensive in a legacy environment. We're also rolling out our Equifax cloud-based Interconnect and Ignite platforms for marketing and risk and decisioning and management products throughout Latin America, Europe, Canada, as well as the United States. As we discussed on our call in February, we're focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. As a reminder, our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the past three years and our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue delivered by NPI revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we've increased our 2021 vitality index guidance from 7% by 100 basis points to 8%, as you can see from the left side of the slide, is a significant increase from about 500 basis points in 2020. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products, and growth. Turning to slide 16, M\u0026A plays an important role in our growth strategy and will be central to our long-term growth framework. Our team is focused on building an active pipeline of bolt-on targets that will both broaden and strengthen Equifax. Our M\u0026A strategy centers on acquiring accretive and strategic companies to add unique data assets, new capabilities, deliver expansion into identity and fraud, or expand our geographic footprint. In the first quarter, we closed five acquisitions totaling $866 million across strategic focus areas of identity and fraud, Workforce Solutions, open data, and SME. We discussed three of these transactions with you in February, which were the acquisitions of Kount and Kount score, and Credit Works. As I discussed earlier, we're excited about expanding opportunities we see from the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. In March, we closed two Workforce Solutions bolt-on transactions, HIREtech and i2verify, which will further broaden and strengthen our Workforce Solutions business. HIREtech is a Houston-based company that provides employee-related tax credit services as well as verification services. HIREtech also has unique channel relationships to provide these services through payroll providers, consulting firms, and CPA firms. i2verify is a Newburyport, Massachusetts-based company that provides secure digital verifications of income and employment services. The company has a unique nationwide set of record contributing employers with concentrations in the healthcare and education sectors. i2verify also brings unique records to the twin database, all of which are contributed by direct relationships. You should expect Equifax to continue to make acquisitions in these strategic growth areas that offer unique data and analytics to our customers with a goal of increasing our topline by 100 to 200 basis points annually from M\u0026A. Before wrapping up, I want to speak to you about an area of significant focus at Equifax and importance to me personally. Slide 17 provides an overview of Equifax's ESG strategy and how it helps position us for long-term sustainability. I hope you saw and had a chance to read our annual report letter that highlighted our increased focus on ESG. First, Equifax plays an important role in helping consumers live their financial best. A primary example of this is that, our alternative data assets, such as utility and phone payment data, provide lenders with a better picture of the approximately 30 million US individuals that do not have traditional credit files or access to the formal financial system. I've also made advancing inclusion and diversity a personal priority since I joined Equifax. Believing that diversity of thought leads to better decisions, we've taken clear steps to broaden diversity at Equifax, including the last 3 Directors added to our Board are diverse, and all 7 individuals have been added to my Senior Leadership Team since I joined 3 years ago, have also been diverse. We're carrying out this focus on inclusion and diversity across Equifax. We're also focused on environment -- on our environmental impact and greenhouse gas footprint. Our cloud transformation will move our existing legacy technology infrastructure to the cloud, which will dramatically reduce our environmental impact as we leverage the efficiencies and carbon-neutral infrastructure at our cloud service providers. Over the course of this year, we -- or over the course of last year, we decommissioned 6 data centers, over 6,800 legacy data assets and over 1,000 legacy applications. We have a detailed program underway to baseline our energy usage and benefits from our cloud transformation as we work towards a commitment regarding carbon emissions and a net zero footprint. We're also committed to being the industry leaders regarding security, with the leadership of our CISO Gamefirst, our culture quick security first. All employees are required to take a mandatory security-focused training sessions every year. And all of our 4,000 bonus eligible employees have a security role in their annual MBOS. We believe -- we also believe in sharing our security protocols and strategies with our partners, customers and competitors to collaborate to keep us all safe. In 2020, we hosted our inaugural Customer Security Summit, where we detailed our progress on security transformation and discussed advancements in supply chain security. As threats continue to evolve, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our security efforts. Wrapping up on Slide 18. Equifax delivered a record-setting first quarter and we have strong momentum as we move into second quarter in 2021. Our 27% overall and 20% core growth in first quarter reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model while still operating in a challenging COVID environment. We've now delivered 5 consecutive quarters of sequentially improving double-digit growth. We're confident in our outlook for 2021. And as John described are raising our full year midpoint revenue by 500 basis points to $4.65 billion and our EPS midpoint by 9% to $6.9 a share. Our revised revenue estimate of 12% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of the range, off of a very strong 17% in 2020 reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the EFX business model. Our increased 2021 growth framework incorporated our expectation as John discussed that the US mortgage market will decline about 8% in 2021 and while operating in a still recovering COVID economy. Our expectation for core revenue growth of 16% in 2021 reflects how our EFX 2023 strategic priorities are delivering. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter of 59% growth and will continue to power Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond. The work number is our most differentiated data asset and workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. Rudy Ploder and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers; new records, new products, penetration, and expansion into new verticals with our differentiated twin database. USIS also delivered an outstanding quarter of 19% growth highlighted by non-mortgage revenue growth of 15% and 11% organic non-mortgage growth. We expect our non-mortgage growth to accelerate as the US economy recovers. The acquisition of Kount is providing new opportunities and products in the rapidly expanding identity and fraud marketplace and USIS continues to outperform the mortgage market from new products, pricing, and increased penetration. USIS is clearly competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond. International grew in the first quarter for the second consecutive quarter, overcoming economic headwinds from significant COVID lockdowns and slower vaccine rollouts in our global markets. Our expectations are high for ongoing sequential improvement in international during 2021 and for accelerating growth as their underlying markets recover from the COVID pandemic. We're also making strong progress rolling out our new EFX cloud technology and data infrastructure and remain confident, as John described, in the significant topline, cost, and cash benefits from our new EFX cloud capabilities. These financial benefits will ramp as we move through 2021 and continue to grow in 2022 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed-to-market and ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong performance -- operating performance is allowing us to continue to accelerate investments in new products leveraging our new Equifax cloud capabilities. And we're off to a strong start in 2021 with 39 NPIs in the first quarter on top of the record 134 we launched in 2020. And our strong outperformance is fueling our cash generation, which is allowing us to reinvest in accretive and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. As discussed earlier, we closed five acquisitions and strategic growth areas in the first quarter and we have an active M\u0026A pipeline. We look for bolt-on acquisitions that will strengthen our technology and data assets and that are financially accretive with the goal of adding 100 to 200 basis points to our topline growth rate in the future. I'm energized about what the future holds for Equifax. We have strong momentum across all of our businesses as we move into second quarter. We're on offense in position to bring new and unique solutions to our customers that only Equifax can deliver, leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and our strong results and the increased guidance that we provided reflect that. With that, operator, let me open up for questions. \nOperator: Thank you very much.  All right. We'll take the first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the over 20% EWS revenue growth guide for this year, can you quantify contributions you expect from new unique record growth, pricing, and new use cases?\nMark Begor: Yes, I think the answer is yes. Those are all meaningful levers. I would add the system, system integrations in our mortgage market and other solutions is also a lever for growth. David, I think as you know, we don't break those out specifically, but it starts with records. We've clearly had a real focus on some room momentum in adding records to the TWN Database as you know we have a dedicated team that that's all they do. And we've got active dialogues going with individual corporations to bring their data to us as we add new services like UC claims and Watsi and all the myriad of services that we provide and also with other payroll processors. And as you know in February, we announced that our plan -- and we're on track to add one of the major payroll processors records to our database in the second half of 2021, which will add meaningfully. And I think you know our business model as we grow records, we're able to monetize those really instantly because of the inquiries that we receive just drive our hit rates up. We clearly have the ability to use price, which we talked about. I think you've seen a real increase in the focus on new products at Workforce Solutions, particularly as they're becoming cloud-enabled. It's giving them the opportunity to bring new solutions to the marketplace to really leverage their data sets. And these new solutions are typically at higher price points and delivering more value to our customers. So that's another big lever. We've talked about – in the second half that, they're continuing to focus on systems and system integrations, and we just find higher usage when customers move from accessing the TWN database through the web to system-to-system integrations, we get really all their volume, which is another big lift. And as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still on track to launch our new agreement with the Social Security Administration. It's a very meaningful contract that will go live in the second half and we expect that to be $40 million to $50 million in run rate. So there's a large amount of levers available for workforce Solutions. As you point out, it starts with records and while we've grown records to 90 million uniques in the quarter. As you know, there's 155 million non-farm payroll. So there's a lot of room between 90 million and $155 million as we continue to grow towards having the full data set. And then we talked before that we're also widening dataset beyond W2 income, including 1099 and other data sources as we look for other ways to include other portions of the US population around are they working and how much do they make.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You closed 2020 at almost 60% EBITDA margin for EWS. Can you quantify operating leverage in this business for 2021?\nMark Begor: Well, there's a lot of leverage, as you could see in the first quarter results. I think you're talking about Workforce Solutions. We're continuing to invest in the business. There's no question about that. But with the revenue growth that we're getting on both the mortgage and non-mortgage side and Workforce Solutions, there's real operating leverage that we expect to continue through 2021.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator:  The next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping, Mark, you could talk about the comments you made towards the end of the call around acceleration of the non-mortgage business with this reopening? And perhaps off that $225 million that you raised revenue by, like how much of that was just the strong performance in EWS, you called out versus maybe some incremental M\u0026A and this reopening benefit that you think you'll see?\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't have any incremental M\u0026A in that guide. We wouldn't include that we haven't completed yet. I think we talked that we have a pipeline and a goal of increasing acquisitions. Of course, we're off to a very fast start this year on M\u0026A. You know this, we took down our framework for mortgage inside of that revenue framework that we shared, which is quite significant. We think that we've got mortgage in the right spot now at down 8% versus the down 5% for the year. And as you know, that the way we frame that as most of that happens, really all of it really happens in the second half. And an expectation that there will be a recovery in the economies as vaccine rollouts continue and lockdowns are reduced, there's still some impact, we believe, of the COVID pandemic in the US market, although, as we pointed out, we saw some real recovery by our customers. And I characterize that as confidence, meaning they're starting originations in the latter part of the first quarter and into April, which we expect that to continue. But you still have -- our international markets are still significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic and we expect that to unfold at some pace during 2021 and that will be a positive as we move forward. Would you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: No, we've just said in the past, right, that increasingly, as we go through 2021, as the non-mortgage markets recover, increasingly, their contribution to core growth is going up, right? So, we're -- so we expect that to continue as we go through the year. And the outperformance in the first quarter, as we said, more than half of it was driven in our non-mortgage segments, and you're seeing that obviously flow through the rest of this year as well.\nMark Begor: And then I would add to it, too, that I hope you caught our comments around, we really feel like the Equifax cloud is providing benefits. Our NPI focus is providing benefits that will benefit our mortgage business as well as our non-mortgage business. And of course, the majority of Equifax is non-mortgage, but the initiatives that we launched over the last couple of years, the investments that we've made over the last couple of years we feel are starting to pay off. When you talk about USIS, we mentioned many times even over the last year, on each of these quarterly calls that we feel a real strength in the marketplace by our USIS team competitively. Commercially, how they're going to market. I think we've talked about we've rebuilt that team a year ago and there's some room momentum there. And again, the focus on new products, those are driving revenue growth and we guided up 100 basis points in our vitality index. The bulk of that is going to come in our non-mortgage business.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And Mark, I was hoping you could just help us also, just appreciate the different moving pieces in the -- I think you talked about Workforce Solutions growing about 20% this year, but there's obviously a lot of moving pieces between employer and verification services. I was just hoping you could give us some guidance there on how they should end up in the year.\nMark Begor: You want to try it on that?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So -- yes, I think in Mark's script, we tried to walk through what the real big drivers, right? Verifier is continuing to perform extremely well. Obviously, mortgage is a bit of a draw -- a drag. But as you go through the rest of this year, if you think about what we said in February, we'd indicated that for total mortgage for Equifax, that even though the market was down 5%, we expected revenue to grow more than 10%. And even though we now have the market weaker at down 8%, we still expect mortgage revenue to grow more than 10%. But some significant drivers of EWS in 2021 continue to be in the non-mortgage segment. We talked about talent solutions growing very, very fast, almost doubling, I think we said in the first quarter and I-9 also growing very, very fast and a recovery in WFA. So what we think you're going to see is very nice growth across the non-mortgage segments, obviously, excluding UC, where we gave very specific guidance. And then also continued good performance in mortgage despite the fact that the market is slowing, right? We're not going to quantify each of those. But directionally, that's what's going on.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson:  Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question guys. I just wanted to touch on EWS, particularly the momentum and increased adoption you guys are seeing in some of the non-mortgage. Could you guys dive a little more into where the strongest area is that – is that in other lending products like auto or card or where is some of the strength that you guys are seeing coming from right now?\nMark Begor: Yes. Non-mortgage is obviously more than financial services. I'll come back to that, but we've talked a bunch about our government vertical, which is growing quite positively. Our employer services is non-mortgage. Our talent Solutions business, so we talked about the growth there. And I think specifically, you're talking about non-mortgage verification. So, I'll go back to that versus non-mortgage broadly in workforce because we've got a bunch of levers that are outside of verification that are growing quite positively, again, excluding the negative impact of UC Claims on a year-over-year basis. So in financial services as you know, mortgage is our largest in verification, for sure and we're getting real leverage and outgrowing the market there. So first, records health everywhere. Right? So, in -- whatever the solution is, as we grow our records and of course, they're up 10% year-over-year and we've got a clear path to increase them in 2021, and that's part of our framework. Those hit rates are good in any vertical you're in, whether it's mortgage or auto or government, etcetera. So records are number one. We’ve had a real focus on new products broadly in Equifax and in Workforce Solutions. And then you talk about some of the verticals, we're seeing increased usage in auto, where -- kind of year ago or 2 years ago, it was more of a subprime usage along with the credit file. Now we're seeing it more in near prime. So there's just more usage in the auto sector and broader usage at those lower credit scores. So that's helping there. Personal loans has always been a pretty strong space for us in the Fintech market for verification, using it because if you think about a personal loan, it's $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, it's a very large transaction. And verifying how much someone makes and are they employed at the time of the loan is a very important lift in the predictability. And then we've talked really for the last, I think, 3 or 4 quarters about the fact that we're seeing a number of card issuers take our data and of course, a sliver of our data. We don't – given the depth of data that they would have in a mortgage application and using it in originations, in other applications in the card space. And we've got now, I believe, 2 of the large card issuers that are using our data ad origination along with the credit file, which is a big breakthrough. We've been chasing this market for some time. I'm an old card originator. I did that for a decade before Equifax. The predictability of adding is someone working and how much do they make to the credit file enhances every credit decision. And it was really around getting our database to scale. And we've talked the last couple of quarters that as we've gone over 50% hit rates in the database, as we get to that 90 million uniques versus the $155 million non-farm payroll, it becomes a data set that's more usable because you get more hit rates. So, that's another thing that we -- reason we think we're getting more new uses of it in things like that cards.\nJohn Gamble: Only thing I'd add, right, and as Mark said, our two biggest segments in verifier are government and talent solutions, and they're growing very fast. And both of those are highly benefited by the depth of the database by the fact that we have over 450 million total records. Being able to pry history in those market segments is very important. So, we're seeing very strong growth in the two biggest nonmortgage verifier segments of both government and talent solutions.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's really helpful color. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on the verification side of the business, like increased noise in the last few months with Transunion and Clad, both making some splashes in that space. Have you guys noticed any change in competition when you guys go-to-market either with users of the verification services or potential employers, pay providers, et cetera?\nMark Begor: We have not. We actually hear mostly about it from you, meaning the sell-side. And we talked many times that we think we have a strong franchise. The scale of our database is extremely large. I think of the 90 million uniques at 150 million actives, the ability to get those kind of records is quite challenging, we believe, meaning to have a database that's usable. Having a database that has $1 million or $2 million or $3 million or 10 million records, it's just very challenging for -- to take that to market. When we can deliver over 50% hit rates, it just is quite challenging. And I think you know 60% of our records come from individual companies and we get those records through long-term relationships. We've been doing this for a decade. We have a full suite of services. We provide HR managers that allow us access to those records and we provide that service, the income employment piece of that for free to the company and to their employees, and it's a real benefit to them. So, those kind of services are really required, we think, to have a database of our scale. And as we've talked, the other 35% or so of our database comes from payroll partnerships and the bulk of those are exclusive, meaning we're an exclusive arrangement, they're not going to provide those records to someone else. So, we think that's quite challenging. And you add on top of that, that we've been investing in this business for over a decade. We've put about $2 billion into it, including a couple of acquisitions just in the last 30 days, the strengthened Workforce Solutions. In the last two or three years, we've probably invested $200 million to $300 million in the technology of the business. This is -- requires a massive investment. And I'm not sure the competitor you reference is thinking about or planning to have the kind of investments that we have. And just to be clear, we intend to protect and grow our franchise.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That’s really helpful for us. Thanks guys. Next quarter.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question on the Fraud and ID business. You had mentioned e-commerce maybe retail as new verticals with the Kount deal. And at the same time, you talked about scale. Could you maybe talk about whether the fraud and ID business is at scale today? How do you define scale? And just as part of that discussion, you've seen companies like Mastercard recently buy Encarta. Mitek is doing some stuff around ID. Is there a lot more M\u0026A opportunity in this market? How do you think about sort of when this business scales or if it's at scale today?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's a great question. It's one that's been a deliberate focus of ours. You've heard us talk about it for the last couple of years that it's a fast-growing space, the ID and broad space globally is, I don't know, $18 billion, something like that, growing at 20%. You've seen -- we've had growth there. We've been in it for a long time. We have a lot of existing differentiated data assets at Equifax around ID and fraud and the Kount acquisition was quite strategic for us. They have real scale. And I think as a reminder, they play in the retail e-commerce space. Have real scale around their interactions. I think it's 32 billion consumer interactions per year. They've got 400 million unique e-mail addresses verified. They've got cellphone addresses are verified, IP addresses. So just a wealth of data. And the power is really combining their data with ours. And that's really why we acquired Kount. And as you point out, it also brings us into a new vertical. We weren't in the retail e-commerce space and that's where Kount plays. And of course, we're going to bring Kount and their data financial services, banking, telco, insurance, where we play. So that's why we acquired Kount? The answer is yes. You heard me comment earlier this morning on the call that, when we think about new M\u0026A or additional M\u0026A, ID and fraud is a place that we want to continue playing in. We see opportunities. We have opportunities in our pipeline to continue to strengthen the combination of Equifax and Kount going forward. And then when you -- your question of scale, from our perspective, the combination of Equifax and Kount gets us into kind of a strong market position, but it's a huge market at $18 billion. So, there's a lot of room to grow. And we look at product introductions. We're investing in like our new Luminate platform gets us more capabilities organically in this marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that out and then acquisitions like Kount really strengthen our data assets and the combination of Equifax and Kount is quite powerful. So you should look for us over the coming years to find ways to grow. Certainly, we're going to invest organically, but also to invest through M\u0026A to strengthen this. We like the space and we want to be bigger in it.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. And my second question, I've asked this before a couple of quarters ago, but I think I'm going to ask it a bit differently. So, if we exclude Workforce Solutions and we just look at USIS and the margin differential just between USIS and international, it's pretty large. And then if you look at your international margin and you compare it to your competitors, there's also a big gap. And so I realize that -- so we're taking Workforce Solutions out of the mix. And so then maybe there's some mix differentials between USIS and international. And I realize international has to get the revenue where you get the incremental margin and the op leverage, and that's maybe in earlier innings. But could you -- how much of the gap can you close between international and USIS and how much of the gap is structural? And we're excluding Workforce Solutions here.\nMark Begor: And again, we don't exclude Workforce Solutions, but we'll just do that for your discussion and really focus on those other businesses. Obviously, USIS has real scale, and that scale drives their margins. And that's clearly a big difference when you think about our international. International, we're in 25 countries. We have some larger businesses like Australia, that's over $300 million and then some smaller countries that we play in. So, that drives a difference in the margins between our USIS, which has really massive scale versus our international businesses. We're always focused on improving our margins. The cloud investments that we're making will benefit Workforce Solutions margins, USIS margins and international and GCS margins. That's part of our strategy to improve our cost structure. But there's no question the subscale nature of some of our international markets result in margins being lower, which I would characterize as structural, but we see opportunities to improve those margins going forward. Would you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. As you look at the countries we're in, the countries that are looking more like USIS, where they're more specifically, like, for example, Canada, margins are much better, right? And so as Mark said, it really depends on the size of the market and then the diversity of the market that we're playing in. And then -- and so we certainly expect to see improvements in margins as we go to the cloud. But some of it certainly is structural just by the fact that we're in so many markets, and some of those businesses are very small. So, not to get into specific numbers, we do expect to see improvements in those margins over time. But some of it is structural. We have no expectation that they're going to reach the type of margins we see with USIS.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. I wanted to hear about the different areas of US credit applications, meaning card and auto and personal loan with large pickup in non-mortgage USIS online revenues accelerating to 16% in the first quarter, in particular, I don't think we've heard the credit card issuers talk about loan growth picking up yet, and I just wanted to know if you anticipate that soon?\nMark Begor: I think we said, Andrew, that it was fairly broad-based. And some of the marketing spend is card issuers starting to, I would characterize, restart originations but that's the marketing piece. That doesn't necessarily result in loan growth yet. I think that's the -- starting to spend money and starting to put new offers out in the marketplace that presumably would result in some loan growth either in second or third quarter, but there's a lag on that between the marketing spend and when those originations go on their books and become loans. Broadly, I would say, what we hear from the US customers is an element of confidence that wasn't in place certainly for most of 2020, certainly, the early parts of 2021. And I think as we've all seen vaccine rollouts in the United States really accelerate and now really, everyone over age 16 can get one, that's resulting in consumer confidence as we seen it in retail spending. And you've seen banks in their earnings releasing reserves, so I think there's an element of confidence of we're moving towards a more normal economy. I would say, we're not there yet, but we saw some real increases what I would call in confidence and it's in our numbers in March and as we moved into April.\nAndrew Steinerman: And auto was strong?\nMark Begor: So auto was stronger than card, right? So if you just kind of tier our structure, auto was stronger than card and identity and fraud was also very strong.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Yes, hi. Thank you. I wanted to focus on costs, if I could, please. Can you give us a sense what your hiring plans are this year in terms of full-time equivalent employees? Are you thinking your plans should maybe pick up hire than other say, 5% more employees in the US? That's my first question. Another related question to that is, as we move through this virus things, hopefully get better, your employees are turned to the offices and stuff in the US, should we expect your cost base to materially go up when that happens?\nMark Begor: Yes. First off, Craig, welcome. I think this is your first Equifax call or at least in recent times. So, it's great to have you covering the company.\nCraig Huber: Thank you.\nMark Begor: On the people side, I would say our employment will be fairly stable. There's some areas where we're investing, like in product resources, in some technology areas. But at the same time, I think you know we've got plans to reduce some of our technology costs as the cloud transformation unfolds. So, there'll be some reductions in that area, which is in our framework. So, I wouldn't think about big changes in our employment. But you should think about Equifax being on offense, meaning we're investing with our strong performance. And of course, our acquisitions that we talked about, the 5 acquisitions bring incremental employees into our headcount, which is in our framework that we've shared with you. With regards to the returnable office, we've been open since last June. We've been very careful about that. It's been really up to our team, if they want to come in. We've limited our occupancy to 50%, no more than 50%, and of course, exercising all those protocols. And we've seen in the last -- I don't know, 30 to 60 days as vaccine rollouts have increased an increase of people coming back to our office. And what we've been telling our employees, when you're vaccinated come back and start operating with Equifax. We also announced post whatever our full reopening is, which is hard to see what that date is. We're going to -- we introduced what we call an Equifax Flex Day where we're going to have some flexibility in our workforce that they can pick on '1 day per week with their managers approval to work remotely. And it was really a reflection on that there are many benefits that we learned over the last year that we can be productive from working from home, but so-called 4/1, meaning we're going to work from the office at least 4 days per week. Is a reflection that we're a collaborative culture, the teamwork is how we operate, whether it's doing NPIs or technology or new customer solutions, we think that happens best in the office. And to your question about we don't expect our cost to go up. We haven't changed our footprint. We don't expect them to go down as a result of this return to office.\nJohn Gamble: And just as you think about our cost structure, just for perspective, right, we're like most technology companies. Obviously, a significant portion of our cost structure is our own employees. We also have a very significant footprint of contract employees and contractors, right? So, we end up -- we move cost. Obviously, the contractor workforce is more variable to us.\nCraig Huber: And then also if I could ask guys, in the US, where do you think the biggest opportunity is to be able to raise price steady as each year goes on to in the US operations?\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't talk a lot about price, but if you think about our US businesses, which is really I'll leave our consumer business aside GCS, but you think about USIS and Workforce Solutions. We focus on new product rollouts that become incremental margin and many times at a higher price point because they're delivering incremental value to the customer. So, that's one way to get revenue pricing margins. Workflow Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business and differentiated data asset and has more ability to bring more value to our customers that we can monetize with different price points of the solutions we're delivering. And if you think about it, if you look at our hit rates now that are over 50%, and you go back two years ago when they were, I don't know, pick the right number, 40%, 50%-plus hit rate is more valuable to our customers, becomes a data asset that they can use more broadly in their solutions. So, Workforce is clearly a business that has more ability to drive its topline through multiple levers that we've talked about a couple of times on this call.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. Just wanted to ask a bit of a different question on the guide. My interpretation is that it seems like the vast majority of the increase is from the 1Q beat. And then the rest I'm expecting is maybe a better 2Q with 2H in line with your expectations previously. Is that a fair assessment? And I know your mortgage expectations are a little bit lower than before in the rest of the year. It just seems like a lot of your non-mortgage trends are positive. So, I'm just hoping you could provide any extra color on how you're thinking about whether these positive trends continue through the year or not? Thank you. \nMark Begor: Yes, I think, Toni, you got to remember, we have seen in the last 60 days, a weakening -- slight weakening of mortgage inquiries, which we rolled into our new framework. So, we took down mortgage by 300 basis points for the year, which we think is prudent, offsetting that and our ability to guide up is that our outsized and strong performance in non-mortgage in the quarter, and our expectation is that will continue. John?\nJohn Gamble: Look, you're looking at revenue, Toni, right, I mean, the over $200 million increase, right, only less than half of it was really out of the first quarter. And then obviously, yes, the second quarter is stronger. And then the -- as Mark said, third and fourth quarter are impacted somewhat by the much greater decline in the mortgage market. But we are seeing very substantial growth, and we think improvement in the non-mortgage segments. And as you look at revenue, we think a significant amount of the improvement in the guide is from periods after the first quarter.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. And then looking at financial marketing, you mentioned the 20% marketing-related growth. Just curious about why there's -- why marketing dollars are being spent there, but within the consumer indirect business you're still seeing pressure. Just wondering what the disconnect is between that and when you expect the indirect business and consumer to show signs of recovery?\nMark Begor: Yes. Toni, I think about it quite naturally. What we saw and what I would have done when I was running P Capital's credit card business is when, you get in a tough economy, you tighten up originations and stop spending marketing money. In the first place you stop spending marketing money is with third-parties, meaning lead gen companies. Same thing when you come out of a difficult environment, the first place you'll start is your own, you have more confidence in that. It's generally lower cost. It's more efficient desire predictability, and that's what we're seeing. And we do expect our indirect to improve, but it's going to be lag some at least the framework we put together and happened later in the year.\nToni Kaplan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And then we'll take the next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. You’ve touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could walk through the i2 VERIFY acquisition a bit further. How should we think about it contributing to the TWN database in terms of record count? And then relatedly, can you give us a sense for how many other assets like this are out there that could add records to the database in a meaningful way? Certainly, it seems like these types of deals come with some pretty immediate revenue synergies. So, any additional detail on that opportunity set would be helpful.\nMark Begor: Yes. There aren't many of them. We know who all of it – they all are, and we talk to them all the time. There are a handful of companies like i2 VERIFY and HIREtech and as you may know, you've followed us for a while that we've made acquisitions like this over the last couple, 3, 4, 5 years. So, when they're available, we like to make them. And maybe I'll just touch on HIREtech first. HIREtech has what we thought was a very attractive Watsi Solution, particularly delivered through third-parties to companies. And again, one of the ways to get records is to deliver value-added services like Watsi, like I-9, like Unemployment Claims like W2 Management, like ACA2 companies. And then in order to complete those services for them, which are regulatory requirements, you get access to records. And in HIREtech's case, we have a Watsi business so today, but there was -- we thought, very attractive in how attractive in how they deliver those solutions through partners. And we'd like to grow our partner Watsi business, which not only will bring the records they already have, but get access to records in the future. And of course, there's a revenue stream just from providing those Watsi services. As John mentioned, they also have an Economic Recovery Credit, ERC, which is a very special and unique credit in 2021 that there's another way to gain access to records, which will benefit us this year. In i2 VERIFY, a bit different in their approach to market. They have a very attractive. We like the team a lot. As we do in HIREtech, the i2 VERIFY was very advanced around relationships and how they went to market with non-profit organizations, with the healthcare industry or hospitals -- and hospitals and the education or think universities. And there's lots of employees in those kinds of organizations and companies, and they developed a very attractive go-to-market of how they built relationships and delivered those services. And so we like that, which is why we were very attracted to i2verify, and we're looking for them to really expand our relationships through different services we provide to those kind of companies and then allow us to get records in order to grow our records. And again, at 90 million uniques, we're very pleased with the scale of our database, but there's a lot of runway between 90 million and 155 million.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Makes sense. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, you've mentioned 100 basis point improvement in your vitality index expectation a couple of times. I imagine that's primarily a consequence of faster than expected adoption on the new product side. So, I was just kind of hoping you could talk about what's driving that specifically through the first couple of months of the year? And then relatedly, what do you think that pickup in adoption means as you think about the vitality index in 2022 and beyond? And how NPIs are expected to contribute over a longer term timeframe? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think you know we've been pretty clear that we've been talking for well over a year, maybe two years about the power of NPI, and that's not new to Equifax. It's not new to our industry. Our competitors are focused on new products. And it really is the fuel for growth that allows us to grow multiples of GDP. That's the inherent in the data analytics business. And we talked a bunch about our investment in the cloud transformation over the last three years from 2018 through 2020, the $1.5 billion we invested in our new infrastructure, we did that for lots of reasons.\nOperator: Please stand by. \nMark Begor: Sorry, we're back. We had a fire alarm go off here, and we just got to shut it off. We're fine. Andrew, sorry, could you repeat your question again?\nAndrew Nicholas: No problem. I can't -- not surprised if that would throw anyone off. Yes. My question was just on the vitality index and how you might look at 2022 and beyond on that metric given the faster than expected adoption so far this year?\nMark Begor: I think I was talking about the cloud investment. We invested in the cloud because we knew it was going to give us cost benefits, security, a competitive advantage, but we really invested in the cloud to deliver new products and growth. And we've been really focused on that over the last 12, 18 months. We talked last year that we've been expanding our resources in new product capabilities. And we think we're starting to see the leverage of the cloud, our ability to bring new solutions to the marketplace. And our guide up was really – we increased our NPI rollouts last year to 139, which was a record. We're 39 in the first quarter, which is up from 35. So, we've got more products in the marketplace. And you've got a commercial team that's out selling them. So that's why we feel the confidence of increasing the guidance going forward, at least for 2021. I don't want to get into 2022 guidance. We'll include that in our long term framework, which we intend to put in place later this year, and the vitality index of new products will be central and really important to us in how we grow the business going forward.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Adam on for Shlomo. Can you talk a little bit more about the unemployment claims strength? Is it from better industry volumes than expected, or does it have more to do with product sales or more clients? Thanks.\nA – Mark Begor: Yes. We've been taking advantage of what's a strong unemployment claims market over the last year and looking for new customer relationships, the teams out there still selling and growing our space. And I think we mentioned we've grown our share slightly to -- we believe, 1-in-3 claims we process versus 1-in-5 maybe in 2020. So, it's just another area of growth we're focused on. And as we also guided, we clearly expect our revenue in 2021 to come down kind of sequentially in the second, third and fourth quarter. But this is a business that is important to Workforce Solutions, processing unemployment claims for companies. It gives us a very nice revenue source long term. We generally sell these on a subscription basis with limits, if you go over a certain number of claims processed, which is why we've had such strong incremental revenue in the high unemployment market in the last couple of years. But we have a very sophisticated solution that operates well in the marketplace. And remember, the second benefit in processing these claims and having this as a business is it gets us access to records that then we can monetize over in our TWN database in our verification business.\nQ – Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from George Mihalos with Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the outlook. I wanted to start-off on mortgage. Again, if we look at verification revenues up another 100%, that's well higher than what you saw in the USIS revenue growth. And as a matter of fact, the growth in EWS has stayed kind of consistent at 100% even if when sort of SIs volumes in mortgage have come down. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that decoupling? Is it as simple, a strong record growth or is there something else that's allowing you to outperform that massively even when volumes come down a bit on the USIS side?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think if you -- we've shown these charts before that Workforce Solutions have been consistently outperforming all markets that they operate in, including the mortgage market. And much more substantially than USIS. They just have more levers. So, they'll use the same levers that USIS use, which is price. So, if you increased price in an up or down market, you're going to have more revenue. New products is one where they just had more opportunities. And you've heard us talk over the last I don't know, four or five quarters about their increased focus on new products. Things like historically, we've had a single report that we'd offer, and now we're offering one with more history on it, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. And instead of having a report that we sell at $25, we've got price points at $150 and $200, and that provides real value to the mortgage originator. And we rolled out a product that's for co-borrowers. A lot of mortgages in the states that have a dual career couple underwritten -- underwriting the mortgage and so we have a new solution there. Instead of having $225 reports polled, we've got a $200 solution. We've got solutions and new products now that encourage more polls. So, we'll have a solution where we sell it at a higher price point that includes multiple polls. So, new products is a real lever for Workforce Solutions. Of course, records we've talked multiple times in this call, adding records drive set rates. Because remember, we're getting inquiries on those mortgages, all those credit cards or auto loans, but your question was around mortgage. We're getting inquiries for the full database, the full set of consumers. And I say, we only have 90 million uniques. And as we grow that database, those hit rates go up automatically. So, records are a very central part of Workforce Solutions' ability to outgrow the mortgage and all their underlying markets. There's also a large portion of mortgages we don't see still. We only see, I think it's 65% of mortgages. So, we're out in the marketplace talking to those that are not doing business with Equifax and are using taste subs or some other mechanism for approving the income and employment elements of a mortgage application to use our solution. The move from a customer, we saw a lot of our customers, I think, over one-third that access our data through the web. Meaning they're actually keying in the mortgage applicants social security number, date of birth, name, et cetera. There's a lot of friction there, meaning it doesn't happen in every mortgage application for that originator or we don't get multiple pulls. So, going to system to system integrations is a big part of our strategy, and we're increasing those system integrations every quarter. We've got a dedicated team that works with mortgage originators to have them do system to system integrations. Another lever is the number of polls in a mortgage application. In a credit application -- on the credit side, there's four to five polls in many mortgage applications of the credit file. Historically, there was more like one to two in the income employment data, we're seeing the more sophisticated originators pull our data more often on every mortgage application. And remember, you think about a couple of elements. Number one, it's a big ticket transaction $250,000, $300,000, $400,000 or more is the loan. And then second is the mortgage originator that's spending $4,000, $5,000 in the application process, they want to make sure that they're spending time on an applicant that they can close on. So, not only verifying their credit multiple times in the process, but making sure that applicant is still working and how much they make as a part of the application process is another big opportunity. So, there's just a half dozen of very strong levers that all have dedicated teams on it, and they've been executing very strongly on those levers. Another kind of overriding macro, if you will, for Workforce Solutions is just really the scale of the database. Now, if you go back at our last economic crisis in 2008, 2009 or pick your year, go back three, four, five years ago, our database in Twin might have been having hit rates of 30% or 40%. Now that we're well over 50%, it becomes a very valuable data asset and all of our customers know that you enhance the credit decisioning of an applicant, if you add is someone working and how much do they make to their credit file. That drives predictability. And so, when you have a database that almost is at a catalyst or an inflection point of going over 50%, we think that's another positive factor. Of course, we've got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do in workforce. And we're quite optimistic about the long-term impact of our fastest-growing business with margins and revenue growth rates that are highly accretive to Equifax.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay. That's super comprehensive. So really appreciate that. And just really quickly, Mark, maybe going back to Andrew's question, on the FMS side, the increase that you're seeing in marketing for card solicitations and the like. Is it too early to know, if the success rate or the hit rate for the banks are in line with what they saw historically as they rolled out those programs?\nMark Begor: Yes. We wouldn't have visibility to that. But what -- I'll tell you what we do find is that all of our finance – this is a macro that started before COVID is that all applications, all uses of data, whether it's in banking, credit cards, mortgage, auto, lending, telco, all of our customers want to use more data. And they want to use more differentiated and alternative data because it enhances the predictability of the decision they're making. And let's use originations. And that's why you're seeing more alternative data being used. We think our cloud transformation is going to differentiate us and the ability to house that data to – and as well as surface and deliver that data to our customers. And then, of course, TWN we talked earlier in this conversation in the call this morning about the power of that data set in that credit decisioning, meaning, is someone working, how much are they making added to the credit file and the other alternative data is very, very powerful.\nOperator: And the next question is from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if -- first off, so apologies, I was actually dropped off on my Internet connection during this call. And I was wondering if you could just refresh me on the growth targets for 2021 for the segments that you laid out, please?\nMark Begor: Sure, Simon. We had a dropped off, too. We had a fire alarm go off, but there was not a fire. So we were off for a few minutes, too. Do you want to tie use us the growth rates by segment that we raised earlier?\nSimon Clinch: Yes. Okay, sure.\nMark Begor: So we indicated that we expected Workforce Solutions to be up over 20%. We indicated we expected USIS to be up mid to high single digits. We indicated we expected international to be up constant currency high single digits and that we expected GCS to be down mid-single digits and also expected GCS to be down mid-single digits in the second quarter.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Great. So, I was wondering, if I could follow-on from that, just on the international business then. I mean, this is -- obviously, with what happened through the pandemic because the comparisons are incredibly easy. And given sort of where we're expecting the framework you provided for a recovery out of the pandemic at the back end of this year. I'm curious as to sort of how sensitive do you think about that sort of high single-digit number is? Because it seems to me it should be fairly easy in some ways to drive significantly higher growth for this -- for the international segment. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color around that.\nJohn Gamble: Yes, I would say, Simon, we're counting on a recovery of the international markets, but I think there's still a pretty decent amount of uncertainty in those markets. And you follow it, too, but Canada's vaccine rollout is really slow. And they've got locked down back in place in other markets. Australia's vaccine rollout is like really slow, like, not happening. I'm not sure when they're going to get a vaccine rollout. So, they're kind of locked down. There's still pressure on that economy. UK, they've got the vaccines out there, but they've still got high COVID cases. So, we've got lockdowns in the UK. With some other markets, a big market for us like Chile, they used, I think, the Chinese vaccine that turns out to be not effective. So, it rolled out. So, they've got lockdowns in place. So, I think the -- we expect them to recover, we expect the vaccines to get in place during 2021, but I think there's still some uncertainty there. And in our framework, we do -- we are counting on and expect to see some improvement. And you saw in our numbers, we've got some markets that are adapting to COVID, like the US did. I think some of the international markets took longer to adapt, meaning the US in some markets like auto and others in second and third quarter last year figured out how to sell cars virtually and other things. That happened more slowly from our perspective in international markets, but you're starting to see that. Canada had a very strong quarter for us in the first quarter. Australia did too, even notwithstanding these COVID lockdowns. So, we expect international to improve, but I'd say that we're watching it because there's still some uncertainty there.\nMark Begor: And remember, our fourth quarter of 2020 in international was okay. We grew in the fourth quarter of 2020, right?\nSimon Clinch: Of course. Okay. I was wondering if I could just have a quick follow-up as well. And maybe just one more for you, John. Just when I think about the push the uses margins going forward, because I know you don't break out the tech transition cost by quarter, but when I think about the underlying incremental margins of this business. I mean, could you give me a little color how to think about that? And then layer on top, the potential dilution from acquisitions to margins and how we should think about that beyond once we move beyond that sort of the year post those deals?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we did give some perspective, right, on USIS this quarter. We indicated kind of the negative movement in their margins was up two-thirds driven by tech transformation. So, to give you some perspective and what we said is over the longer term, we expect to see improvements in margins, driven by the fact that we're going to drive substantial cost benefits related to the tech transformation. But we wouldn't start to see those benefits occur until late 2021 and then really kicking in, in earnest in 2022. So, as we think about the movement in margins, the drivers of the margin, obviously, will be as tech transformation spend start to decline as you move through 2021 and into 2022, really moving into 2022. And then as we start to get savings related to those decommissionings that will occur as tech transformation completes, and that doesn't really start to have a net savings of decommissioning more than cloud costs until very late in 2021 and then obviously accelerating in 2022.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. And so incremental costs from acquisitions that you've already made are really going to be minimal?\nJohn Gamble: So, we expect acquisitions we make to move to USIS type margins over a reasonable period of time, right? So, certainly not in the first year. But then as we move into year two and certainly year three, we expect them to deliver margins like the rest of the business. And the acquisitions are all accretive to generally, our revenue growth rates in each of the businesses. For example, Kount, we're really excited about the space they play in and their historical growth and the opportunities with the synergies between USIS and Kount on both the top line and some of the cost synergies.\nSimon Clinch: Yeah. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hey. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question. I know it's been kind of a long call. Just very high level, Mark. What I'd like to try to understand, if you can help is, just simplistically, how much do you think of your non-mortgage strength, in particular, is being driven by a snapback in share gain? Obviously, there was a period of time over the last few years where Equifax was focused internally. And you’ve clearly ridden the ship and accelerated NPI and are making what is apparently a very effective cloud transition. Are we seeing normalization in share? How much of that is playing a role in this growth, non-mortgage and mortgage in that matter, just broadly?\nMark Begor: Yeah. I think we tried to be clear and we used this phrase last year for -- I think all four quarters last year that we feel like based on the wins, the USIS and Sid Singh and his team are landing in the U.S. marketplace in USIS space, that we're competitive. And we're winning in the marketplace. We've talked about the deal pipeline. We shared some metrics earlier in the call that it's up 30%. And so, what are the factors there? There's no question, we were pressured in 2018 and 2019 after the cyber event competitively. We were in the penalty box with a lot of customers. It took us a while to get out of them, meaning through the end of 2019. In 2020, we were on, what I would characterize in the first quarter, kind of, a normal competitive footing and then COVID hit, which created some visibility challenges, perhaps for you. But in that time frame, we kept a consistent dialogue with you that USIS was winning and was competitive in the marketplace. So you've got the commercial -- the post cyber event is clearly behind us. We're on our strong footing commercially. We think we're advantaged commercially with the cloud transformation. When you think about it, it's actually quite logical. If you're a commercial leader and you're out talking to one of your customers and say, hey, Equifax just invested $1.5 billion in our technology to support you. That creates a very positive dialogue. And then you add to it Equifax's differentiated data assets that we have, data assets, our competitors don't, which we think helps us commercially. And you can lead with twin, obviously, which, as you know, USIS sells in the marketplace for us is one commercial team. They sell twin to all our financial customers. And then add to it, NCTUE, IXI, DataX. So we think advantaging us. The leveraging of the cloud for new products is clearly taking hold. USIS is -- the rest of the business, rolling out these new cloud-based products that we think are giving us an ability to bring new solutions to drive incremental revenue with our customers in the mortgage and non-mortgage space, which is quite positive. So we think there's a lot of momentum. There’s still more to do. But the team is really focused. I think the last point I'd raise is that, we brought in no longer, a new leader, two years ago, Sid Singh, but he used 2019 to rebuild the business and the team and continue that in 2020, they're hitting on their strides. We relevered the team. We've got a new Chief Revenue Officer. We've got Sid, who's a very commercially oriented leader. I think that's benefiting USIS also in how they're operating in the marketplace.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for John, just quickly. Any unusual timing items we should be thinking about, John? I mean, just it seems like EWS mortgage is holding up really well as the mortgage market weakened. Is there any timing vis-à-vis your growth versus the market as a whole?\nJohn Gamble: The timing to be aware of, which I'm sure you're aware of because it happens every year, right? Is in EWS and Employer Services, the Employer Services revenue was strongest in the first quarter substantially because several of the services they provide, think W-2, think workforce analytics are directly related to tax file. And since that's the case, their revenue is much higher in those segments in the first quarter. And during that period, obviously, the margins are very strong in those businesses. So you see stronger margin in Workforce Solutions. And it also obviously benefits Equifax in the first quarter. And generally, there's a negative trend sequentially going into the second quarter for that reason. The other thing that just timing related, related to Equifax is our annual salary increases or merit increases are generally pretty much uniformly at April 1st. So, you tend to see a cost increase occur in the company in the second quarter, okay? And that brings margins down, okay? So those are two things that are just timing related. But other than that, no, I think we're just what we're seeing in EWS and really across the business is just good execution.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your guidance for 2021 core revenue growth was upwardly revised from 10.5% previously to 16% at the midpoint. Approximately how much of the increase in core revenue growth you estimate is coming from non-mortgage compared to outperformance within the mortgage market?\nJohn Gamble: Remember, we took our mortgage guidance down, so you should think about that. That clearly is a negative impact on that. And the whole offset is from nonmortgage. It's why we're raising a ton.\nMark Begor: Yeah. So George, we've said pretty consistently, right, that as we move through 2021, you're going to see an increasing contribution to core revenue growth from non-mortgage relative to mortgage. Obviously, in the first quarter, we saw really good outperformance relative to the mortgage market across EWS as well as USIS, and we indicated I think in an earlier answer to a question that even though the mortgage market is going to be weaker by three points in the year, we'll still grow faster than 10%, right? So we're going to see better performance, better outperformance relative to the market than we had previously guided. So there is some benefit to core revenue growth from better outperformance in the mortgage market. But, obviously also you're seeing a substantial contribution now that's starting to occur as you move through 2021 from the non-mortgage market.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, Equifax hasn't yet reinstated its long-term financial framework. What do you need to see in the business before you feel comfortable reinstating long-term target?\nJohn Gamble: Yeah, George, we talked to you before. And I was clear earlier in the discussion this morning that we're intending to put that in place in 2021. We said in February and same comment to you now is that we wanted to see a few more quarters -- a few more months perhaps of the COVID recovery, things are still -- volatile is the wrong word, but still evolving, the mortgage market from just, I don't know, less than 90 days ago is has softened. And of course, the COVID recovery, I would say, is stronger than we anticipated in the last 60 days in the non-mortgage side. So, we want to see a few more months of that, but we know what we want to do. We're ready to do it. We've given, hopefully you a lot of indications of how that's going to be framed. And it's our intention to put that in place in concert with likely an Investor Day. In – before the end of the year in 2021.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. So my question is on Slide 9 and the middle chart, EWS core mortgage growth. So, it was 99%. And I think you have 9% records growth. So it's a 90% core ex records growth, mortgage growth and verification services. If I look back to 2020, it also had this massive step up, 80%, maybe high 60s or 70x records growth. It used to be in this -- I guess, 11% to 21% range and probably half or more than half of that was record. So there's a much bigger contribution starting in 2020 from those ex records factors. And Mark, you repeated several times, all of the factors that go into that. So, I don't need you to repeat that. But what is so different about 2020 and going into 2021 in terms of -- like, I don't know if it's the inflection, if it's the tech transformation, like if it's a specific factor, just what's so different about 2020 and 2021 in that regard?\nMark Begor: I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. And we've said to you and others repeatedly, there is a degree of inflection point. When you're north of 50% kind of hit rates, we think it becomes a more valuable asset in so many other cases. And I'll just use my example, 10 years ago, when I was at GE Capital, we didn't use the data asset because the hit rates were, I don't know, 25%. It just didn't make sense to put it in your workflows when you can only hit 1-and-4 customers. Now that you're over 50, we believe there's an element of inflection there. We also believe that cloud transformation is a big deal. And that's across Equifax, but workforce is benefiting from that. For example, ingesting the amount of records, but even more complex is ingesting the amount of employers that we now have in the data set. If you go back 18 months ago, we may have had 150,000 employers or 200,000, something like that. And now we're well over 1 million companies contributing a data set. We couldn't have done that without the cloud. And remember, when we get those data records, they're generally in different formats, and your cloud capabilities allow you to normalize those and then put them in a format that you can bring them to your customers. And then I won't go through all of the other levers that workforce has. But you know they're pretty wide and broad. And with the scale of the business, meaning the infrastructure we have, the people. We have the resources to invest in really dedicated teams. And I don't mean to repeat this, but we have a dedicated team focused on records, period. That's hard to do. And this is a multi-person team. We have a dedicated team focused on working with our mortgage customers on system-to-system integrations. That's all they do on the benefits. We have another team that's focused on convincing the mortgage originators that aren't doing business to go forward with us. The scale of our business almost becomes a flywheel that allows us to invest in the business. So, I think there's all those, just going back up, what are the bigger macros. It's -- I would say, the inflection point of being north of 50 and the cloud transformation taking hold. And if you followed us for a long time, you know that on a new product front, you didn't hear a lot out of Workforce Solutions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 around new products. Now, with the cloud, we can really take advantage of this data asset. And you know the power of coming up with a new way to monetize a data asset that you've already paid for, meaning the dual borrower mortgage solution; the mortgage solution that allows a mortgage originator to have multiple polls; the mortgage solution that has 36 months of history in it at a higher price point. Those are all opportunities that we've started to deploy in 2020 when we had the EFX cloud really taking hold inside of workforce and across Equifax. And those are the kind of solutions, you should see. And as you know, central to our EFX 2023 strategy is really leveraging the cloud around innovation and new products. And we're excited about our progress there. But we're in early innings on this.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thanks Mark.\nJohn Gamble: And part of this is kind of, right? We talked about three years ago, for every four credit polls; there was one or less than one employer pool, right? Verifications poll. Now, for every two, there's more than one, right? So the level of penetration is up dramatically in the time period you're describing. Which substantially adds to growth, right? And then you also know, obviously, in a period of very rapidly growing market benefit, all variances improved, right? So, we're certainly benefited across the business by the fact that the market is so large, right, but the -- and grew so much faster this year. But the increase in penetration is a huge driver in the past three years.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nMark Begor: Hey Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, how are you? Mark or John, can you give us a sense, given the new product innovation, how we thinking about this more from a longer term subscription perspective versus transactions. And I think there's always been a historical is that this is much more transaction-oriented given the incremental cloud shift, it seems like you're going to be more embedded in your clients, you're introducing more products that become more monitoring. So, how are you thinking about subscription versus transaction growth maybe historically? And where that can be in the business longer term?\nMark Begor: Yes. So, I think our business continues to be heavily transaction focused and likely will continue to be. What -- increasingly, you see minimums in our contracts, but generally not subscriptions, right? We do have some products that are subscriptions, like you said; monitoring services tend to look more like subscriptions. But the vast majority of our revenue generation continues to be driven by -- continues to be driven by transactions. And we benefited from that, obviously, very substantially over the past several years. Businesses where you can -- where you see more things that look like subscriptions are, certainly the unemployment insurance claims business, you see things that look like subscriptions with minimum -- with volume caps in them. So, we have businesses that are structured like that. And we have some businesses that are somewhat more software-focused, where you see more subscriptions. But generally speaking, we're still heavily transaction based and that will likely continue.\nKevin McVeigh: That's helpful. And then can you just remind us, if think about the pool of records within EWS. I know that the target is, I remember, has kind of been about 158 million. But as you think about alternative income sources, things like that, what's the total addressable market you think that's potentially out there based on the capabilities that you have today?\nMark Begor: Yeah. You talked about the nonfarm payroll. There's a lot of runway there and as you know, a lot of economic value as we grow the database in the traditional nonfarm payroll or W-2 income. 1099 is a very big market. I think it's 30 million or 40 million people that have 1099 type income. That's a space that we're adding data records. We don't talk about those, because it's not in our 90 million or 150 million in total. Another data set that we're starting to add, and we have some records now is pensioner income. I think there's 20 million or 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the United States that receive monthly pension checks, either at the state, federal or corporate level. They're applying for credit products. So that's another data set that we're out there chasing. It just goes back to the power of the scale of our business, we have those relationships. For example, a company that we're collecting their active employees from many of those companies also process their pensioner income. So it's an opportunity for us to bring that income into our data set. Same thing with a payroll processor that's doing primarily W-2 income, they're also, in some cases can have 1099 income. So it's another way for us to build those out. So we've got a very clear focus of not only building out W-2, but going beyond that. Another focus that's in early stages is really just getting data around someone logging in or checking in and checking out of their employment, whether it's a restaurant worker logging in through their software that they use to operate in the restaurant, getting that data asset. We might not know how much they're making, but we'll know they're working. So it's another element of data. So we've got a broad focus there around going beyond W-2.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our last question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.\nGary Bisbee: I appreciate you thinking around long enough to answer the question. Just one on the nonmortgage acceleration, which was impressive across the businesses. When I look at USIS, in particular, I don't think that's grown meaningfully in a couple of years. And if I heard you right, ex the acquisitions, it was nearly 11% year-to-year growth in the quarter. Would it be reasonable to think a decent portion of that is an easy comp in March? And -- or is this much more momentum that's really picked up? And if so, what are the key one or two drivers of that sequential improvement in the nonmortgage growth in USIS? Thank you,\nMark Begor: Gary, you know this and just remember is that USIS had a decent quarter in first quarter last year. I think was that 3.5%.\nJohn Gamble: It was certainly, it was low single digit.\nMark Begor: Yeah, something like that in the first quarter last year. And the COVID pandemic really didn't hit them or us until the last two weeks of March. And that 3.5% was inside of the two weeks of March, which really were significantly impacted. So we felt quite good about the progress we have really all through 2020 that the team is really delivering. You've got a lot of factors there. We've already talked about it a bunch in the call about the commercial focus by the team. We think that's real. We think they're getting benefits already from the cloud transformation competitively, meaning wanting to do business with Equifax because we have a different technology infrastructure than our competitors. So that's a positive for them, whether it's on share. You can think about other factors like the NPIs. Those are -- a reminder, we were building NPIs in 2018 and 2019. We really couldn't sell them because we were in the penalty box. We started selling them in 2020, but that's really benefiting them, and we're continuing to accelerate our NPI rollouts. So I think that's a benefit for the business. And then there's an element of COVID recovery. I think we were clear that in March and April, we've seen some of their verticals move back much more strongly than they were earlier in the quarter and certainly stronger than they were in 2020. So I think that's part of that, too.\nGary Bisbee: So would it be safe to say that the step function element of just dramatically better looking growth has more to do with -- you've been making progress, but the COVID impact through much of last year sort of offset that or we couldn't see it through because of progression of that?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think that's fair. I think that’s fair that the COVID environment masks their performance, which is why every quarter, we talked about their deal pipeline to at least give you a metric that we look at on what their commercial activity looks like.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: And I think as Mark mentioned on the call, right, it got better each month, right? So March was certainly by far the strongest month of the three.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. There appears to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Hare, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nDorian Hare: Thanks, everybody, for your interest in Equifax and for joining us today. This does conclude our first quarter earnings call. We look forward to joining you later on this summer to review our second quarter results.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to Masco Corporation First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for playback purposes.  I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDavid Chaika: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2021 first quarter conference call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our first earnings release and the presentation slides that we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. Please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up. If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at (313) 792-5500. Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We describe these risks and uncertainties and our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.\nKeith Allman: Thank you, Dave. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. While we are well over a year into this pandemic, the effects are still being felt. We are encouraged by the rollout of vaccines, but many areas around the globe continue to experience a surge in cases. The safety of our employees remains our number one priority, and I would like to thank all our employees for keeping each other safe and for serving our customers. Through the efforts of our employees and the robust demand we continue to experience for our products, we delivered another outstanding quarter. Please turn to Slide 5. We had a strong start to 2021, and our ability to effectively navigate this highly dynamic environment resulted in exceptional top and bottom line growth. For the quarter, sales increased 25%, excluding acquisitions and currency sales increased 19%. Operating profit increased 61% to $366 million principally due to strong volume leverage and reduced spending in the form of lower travel, entertainment and marketing expenses across our segments. Earnings per share increased an outstanding 89%.\nJohn Sznewajs: Thank you, Keith, and good morning everyone. As Dave mentioned, most of my comments will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items. Turning to Slide 7, we delivered a very strong start to the year as first quarter sales increased 25%. Currency increased sales by 2% in the quarter and the three recently completed acquisitions contributed an additional 4% to growth. In local currency, North American sales increased 21% or 17% excluding acquisitions.\nKeith Allman: Thank you, John. Our markets remain strong and housing fundamentals are supportive of continued long-term growth. Year-over-year home price appreciation increased to over 17% in March and existing home sales were up over 12%. Both of these metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis. Furthermore, the U.S. consumer is healthy with estimated built-up savings of nearly $2 trillion even before the new stimulus money, and consumers continue to invest in their homes. We believe these factors along with the increased demand from the large millennial demographic will lead to continued growth in the repair and remodel markets. With our market leading brands, history of innovation and strong management teams we are well-positioned to capitalize on these growth drivers, serve our customers and deliver value to the shareholders. With that I'll now open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Okay.  The first question will come from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning. Congrats on the results. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start out on the full year margin guide, which is unchanged at 17%. Would you say that I guess Q1 margins, did they come in better than planned or was it in line? I'm trying to understand if you tempered expectations for the balance of the year reflecting all that cost inflation you mentioned. I heard you say peak cost headwind I guess for plumbing in Q3 specifically. Again I'm just trying to understand how the cadence of 2Q to 4Q may have changed versus your prior expectations. Thank you.\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, Matthew, very good morning. It's John. I think there are a couple of things that we experienced through the year. So as you expect the first quarter probably came in a little bit better than we initially expected. But as we look out to the back half of the year and think about margins, I guide you to think about two things. One, I do think because we raised our top line guidance, we now are anticipating a little bit better volume than we anticipated. At the same time, what we are seeing is a little bit more inflation. And so what – I think the two kind of offset each other. And that's what's causing us to maintain our margin guidance at 17% as we called out on our Q4 call.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay, thank you for that John. And second one on the lifting, to your point, the organic growth guidance for the year, I guess it was a similar question with how much of that is driven by Q1 itself. But more broadly, you guys have talked about North American R\u0026R, for example, up low single digits this year. You talked about tougher comps in the second half. And my question is, as we do get further into the year, late April now, is it becoming clear that the backlog of home improvement activity and what consumers are doing may not exactly shift overnight? And maybe that tough comps in the second half you guys had previously spoken to might have a little bit better outlook? Just a similar kind of question there on the organic side. Thank you.\nKeith Allman: Matthew, there is a couple of things going on. One is the real strong – continued strong demand that we've seen in Q1. So the Q1 demand is certainly a factor. When we look at how we exited the quarter and how things are starting this quarter, we continue to see strong demand, a little bit more than what we had initially planned. So nothing is going to move those tough comps in the back half. They're still there, and we have to face them. But when we look at how demand is shaping up both in the quarter and then what we expect going forward and the fundamentals, that really was the rationale for us lifting our guide on the revenue side.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Stephen Kim from Everscore. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much guys. Strong results. Just following up on Matt's question about the margins. I just want to throw in that you also had the refinancing of the debt, probably adds about $0.09 for the full year. I just wanted to get an idea whether that had previously been contemplated in your guide? And then if I heard your answer, John, it sounds like it's higher inputs, which is totally understandable. But you had said, I think, that you're expecting neutrality on input costs by year-end, which I think is pretty much what you thought before. So just to get a sense for the arc of margins through the quarter relative to your previous expectations, are we looking at kind of maybe lower margins in 2Q and 3Q than you had previously thought but then higher in 4Q as you get the neutrality back? And then, of course, you did better in 1Q as well. Is that the kind of the way we should be thinking about the trajectory of margins relative to your previous expectation?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, so a couple of questions there, Steve. Let me try to address those. So first of all, with respect to the interest savings, I think for this year, given the timing of that transaction, it's probably about a $0.05, $0.06 benefit in 2021. Now that said, you may have heard in Keith's remarks, we talked about receiving some proceeds from the sale of cabinet works. That also then contemplates – we need to update our guidance to reflect the fact that we will not be getting interest income from that investment. So I think the net benefit there is, call it, $0.02, $0.03. So – well, I just want to make sure we're clear on that. So as you think about our rate, it's both the first quarter B+, the net impact of interest for the year. Now with respect to your second part of your question about price/cost neutrality, yes, you're correct. What we're committing to is exiting the year at being price/cost neutral. In terms of how that actually plays out through the course of the year, we're having pricing conversations with our customers. And so can't really give you a good clear signal as to when those are all going to flow through and hit the P\u0026L. So I don't want to – I'm not going to give – we're not going to give clear guidance on Q2, Q3 or Q4, exactly how that flows through because those conversations are fluid.\nStephen Kim: Great, that's very helpful. Thanks, John. Second question just relates to the massive beat in plumbing sales. It sounds like it was very broad-based. It certainly came as a welcome surprise to us. And it sounds like it kind of came as a bit of a surprise to you. I just want to make sure that that's correct. Does that mean that things really intensified in February and March? And if you could just provide a little bit of color as you sort of look at it. It sounds like strength is continuing here in April. Exactly what would you attribute that to? Because I'm inclined to think that it's probably going to persist. So if you could just provide a little bit more context around that that would be great.\nKeith Allman: Yes, good morning, Stephen. This is Keith. We are seeing demand stronger than we expected in the quarter. And we're also feeling better about the back half of the year. And when you look across the Plumbing segment, we have strong North American growth, as we talked about, and that really is across all channels. We continue to do very well in retail. Obviously, the DIY component is strong. Our trade plumbing business continues to be strong, and we believe we're maintaining our leadership and growing quite nicely in e-commerce, so strong across the board growth in North America. And then we're seeing a nice recovery in Europe, as we talked about, particularly in Central Europe. The U.K. is starting to get better, and China is really performing nicely. So it's been very broad-based, and it gives us confidence both now as we look at what we're seeing coming into the quarter, but also into the second half.\nOperator: And your next question will come from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions. And the first one is, I think that you had previously outlined about $40 million of delayed investments that kind of accumulated during COVID. I'm curious, what is sort of the cadence that you're expecting of the spend coming back in? And if, in fact, this is contemplated in that 18% SG\u0026A that you're expecting through the remainder of the year?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, John, that $40 million is still contemplated and it's probably more back half loaded. And again, it's all going to depend – the rate of that investment will depend on what we're seeing out in the market. If all of a sudden the market start to contract, we'll be – we'll temper that investment to ensure that it aligns with the growth that we're – that we expect to see.\nJohn Lovallo: Understood, okay. And then maybe just on the raw mats freight headwind. I think you guys talked about mid-single-digit range for the full year and high single digits in 3Q and 4Q. Can you just help kind of parse out the difference between the freight inflation versus the actual raw mat inflation?\nJohn Sznewajs: So…\nKeith Allman: Maybe I will start John and you can get into some of the specifics. In terms of – while we don't normally see this kind of significant commodity changes occurring this quickly, we certainly are no strangers to commodity changes. And this is really part of our business of our business. And we've consistently communicated, John, and more importantly, I think, demonstrated our ability to reach price/cost neutrality through cycles. And this is included garden-variety sort of changes in costs related to the relationship between supply and demand. It's included force majeure kind of spikes in cost and as well as tariffs, which was quite a spike that we were able to cover. So our price/cost neutrality capability is really underpinned by this consistent investment that we've had in our brands and innovation and customer programs and the like, as well as our well-developed ability to drive total cost productivity and to ultimately deliver value to our customers and consumers that they recognize. So we're going to continue with this commitment, and we will reach price/cost neutrality as we exit this year. Now in terms of specifics, John, maybe you want to hit a little bit on some of the commodities and the relative spikes that we're seeing?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, sure. So John, as you referenced, we're seeing both inflation in our raw material baskets, really across the enterprise as well as transportation and logistics. And if you think about this – how we're being impacted, obviously, copper, zinc and the resins that go into paint and packaging have been up pretty significantly. As you – to get to your question specifically, as you break apart the impacts on the financial statements from either raw materials or transportation and logistics, the vast majority of impact comes from the raw material basket. If you think about distribution and logistics, it's a relatively small part of our overall cost structure. That said – and I guess I can repeat your statement. We do continue to expect inflation to be up kind of mid-single digits for the full year in both segments and up high single digits in the second half of the year. And as Keith alluded to, we've secured price increases across our product categories. We do have plans for further price increases to offset the persistent inflation that we've been experiencing. That said, we're not going to shy away. We're going to continue to implement cost productivity improvements across the enterprise as well and then work with both our customers and suppliers to continue to try to offset this inflation. So as we said earlier in response to Stephen's question, we do expect to be price/cost neutral as we exit 2021.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to make sure we're thinking about the – and I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I think it's top of mind with investors. And just trying to appreciate the timing differences around price/cost and make sure we're thinking about it right. Are you basically saying – because earlier, you said, okay, the higher volume – from the margin side, you have higher volumes that are offset by higher inflation? Are we to take that as kind of net inflation, net of your incrementally expected cost increase – I'm sorry, price increases? In other words, it seems like in a perfect world, if you had higher inflation, but you're putting through price increases to offset that, that should be a wash. So are we going to take this that there's this continued lag in price/cost that you're still – maybe chasing is the wrong word? And then potentially, to the extent that you get a fuller benefit of the price increases in 2022, that in and of itself, to the extent that the inflation backdrop remains stable, that could actually turn into an incremental tailwind as you fully catch up to the inflation? Is that a right way to think about it?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, Mike, I think you're thinking about it the right way.\nMichael Rehaut: All right, perfect. And then just more on the overall top line environment. If you could kind of go into a little bit around point-of-sale and inventory levels, what we've heard so far is that from competitors or just broadly in the industry that the demand backdrop has been so robust or continue to be so robust that inventory levels have remained constrained. Has that been the case for your businesses in the first quarter that you haven't been able to necessarily restock at any point? And is this something that you would expect to perhaps happen in the coming quarters to the extent that you're able to increase – continue to increase production?\nKeith Allman: Yes, Michael, the POS is strong. And as I mentioned, it's strong through the quarter and exiting the quarter, and we feel really good about the POS. And that's across really, most, if not all of our categories. With regards to the inventory position, the supply chain has been tight. There's no question about it. We've had disruptions. And hats off, frankly, to our operation team and teams really across the world to be able to leverage our strengths and also our relationships to be – and to work around the clock to move production around and to match production to specific demand and those sorts of things. So they've done a phenomenal job. Having said that, we're still working through some tightness. And I would say, probably and think about it from a Q3 sort of perspective that we will catch up and then start to replenish the inventories because our inventories in the channel aren't where we'd like them to be. So yes, I think upside to some inventory fill in the back half is the right way to think about it.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nKen Zener: Good morning everybody.\nKeith Allman: Good morning, Ken.\nJohn Sznewajs: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zener: Wonder if we could talk about demand a little bit in the plumbing business relative to what you're seeing at retail versus the wholesale versus the new construction. If you could kind of parse that out, trying to think about DIY plumbing as opposed to – and this is for the U.S. please. Trying to think about DIY plumbing and price points as opposed to the pro, which I think will benefit more as people are able professionals – able to get in the house and do larger renovation projects?\nKeith Allman: When you think about teasing out the market in terms of DIY and pro of our two segments, that's hardest to do in plumbing because of the nature of the channels and the fact that plumbing wholesale does have some DIY component to it, and that we just – it's not possible to get that kind of accurate data in terms of that. But we do know that we have a strong mix of DIY – excuse me, of, call it, retail and wholesale in plumbing. Over half of our business is in wholesale, and wholesale certainly skews more towards the pro than DIY. So we feel real good about the mix of that business, in terms of being there to catch improvements in demand, be it on the pro side or on the DIY side. We all know about the strength of DIY. And we expect the pro to start to come back as people are more comfortable having pros in their homes as vaccinations roll out. Specifically to your question of demand, it really has been broad-based across all channels. Real good strength in e-commerce and continued strength in both plumbing wholesale as well as the retail, where we lead in terms of share of shelf position. So that's been really good for us. And international is a nice story. International, we talked about the strong growth rate there, our position in Central Europe. China is doing very well, understanding that there was a relatively easy comp there. But all in, it's been pretty broad-based, and that all feeds into why we've raised our confidence level in our guide.\nKen Zener: Right. Yes, it's nice and it's – to me, you guys mentioned home prices, which is really homeowners equity. It seems as though your sales are tracking with a very high rate of appreciation of homes.\nKeith Allman: Real strong correlation between home price and existing home sales, no question about it.\nKen Zener: Right. And it seems to me that – could you maybe give us a little context, Keith, for – demand is high because prices are up. Assuming your guidance holds, which is that you'll be cost-neutral by the end of the year, it certainly seems as some of these input costs related to the Texas storm might be abating next year. Yet prices are high, and we all know there's a lag on demand from prices. What happens usually when this type of context sets out because it seems like it could be bullish for you – I'm not asking for FY 2022. But if you're able to pass-through the cost, do you usually give back costs? Otherwise, it seems the higher volume growth perhaps lead to a margin adjustment as we look down the road higher.\nKeith Allman: Yes, when you look longer-term through cycles of commodity increases and commodity decreases – and it varies depending on the nature of the cost. And we have inventory that needs to flow through before we get any sort of price change up or down to hit the P\u0026L. But fundamentally, we've maintained and demonstrated neutrality as it relates to those fluctuations in raw material cost inputs and that neutrality comes from real solid total cost productivity improvements. It comes from us really watching our spend very closely. And of course, price is part of that. Now, in terms of the impact of how this could play out, in future quarters or into next year, it's a real volatile environment. What we're focused on is delivering on what we say we're going to deliver on and ensuring that we continue to drive on the exit of next year or this year rather to price cost neutrality and that's what we're committing to.\nKen Zener: Thank you.\nJohn Sznewajs: Ken, one thing I would point out is, given our international business, I'd say, over time, that we're probably slightly price favorable in plumbing, just because HANSGROHE does a good job of going out annually with price increases.\nKen Zener: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Keith Hughes from Truist. Your line is open.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Question is on propane. I know it was weak in the quarter. If you could talk about what you think was going on and what's caused something in the quarter acceleration? And then any kind of April view on that would be helpful as well?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes. So Keith, sorry about that, it's John. So yes, you're right propane was a little bit weak in the first part of the quarter. We did talk about the difficult comp we had faced – the fact that we saw some positive growth in the back half of the quarter – I'm getting a little feedback. So we do believe there there's a pent-up demand, and the fact that people are getting more comfortable with pro contracts, we do think there was probably a little bit of a weather impact as well in the quarter. As the storm moved through Texas and much of the country in mid-February, and so as soon as we saw that passed, we started to see better growth in that business. And so as we look at to the full, the back half of the year, we do continue to believe that we should see high single digit growth as consumers are really getting more and more comfortable having these contractors coming to home and do larger paint jobs.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you. And then final question. We talked a lot about cost. If we look at price/cost, you're talking about your cost peaking in the third quarter. If we look at price/cost, when do you think that negative will peak as you head towards parity in the years, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter? Any view would help.\nKeith Allman: My guests, Keith, and again, it all depends on some of the pricing conversations that we have, probably peaks in the third quarter, and we'll continue to update it that on our subsequent calls.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nPhil Ng: Hey, good morning everyone. Congrats on a very strong quarter. Given the supply chain dynamics you called out, great to say that it really didn't impact you much at all from a revenue perspective in 1Q. But, will that have more of an impact in the second quarter as you kind of worked down, so that inventory you have, I'm particularly curious on any of your exposure where you're importing products from Asia and any of that impact that you may be seeing on shortages from resin?\nKeith Allman: Putting comps aside and just talking about output and disruptions in terms of what we expect, we think it's getting better. It really feels like it's getting better. We're not through it all yet in terms of the hard work that we need to do in terms of matching inventory to demand matching production, to demand and those sorts of things. Still a little bit of tightness and timeliness and containers as we talked about, but it's getting better.\nPhil Ng: Okay. That's great. And then from a pricing standpoint, we all have an appreciation with the pricing power you have in your core plumbing and paint business. But curious if you're seeing price traction for your Kichler product and if your competitors have matched, just because in 2018, there was a little more challenge in that front. And do you anticipate price/cost neutrality as well as you kind of exit 2021 in Kichler?\nKeith Allman: Yes. Yes, we're driving that and that's something that we believe in across the board of Masco. Yes, that would be true with Kichler as well. Kichler is doing well. The team is – we committed to working that business and positioning it to return to growth to 2021. We're ahead of that plan, the team's doing well. We're seeing good continued solid demand. Our new products are doing well, and the structural cost alignments that we've talked about in past calls are bearing fruit and the team is doing a nice job.\nPhil Ng: Okay. Super that's really helpful.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is, you highlighted the strength that you saw in your e-commerce channels in plumbing in the quarter. Can you give us a little more color on what exactly you're seeing there? And how you're positioned there? And anything that you're taking to kind of increase your exposure to that channel and kind of drive those sales going forward?\nKeith Allman: Sure. We expect to continue to grow, obviously, as consumers become more and more comfortable with online purchases in our space. And we also continue to expect rather to continue to gain share. We believe that we're the leader in plumbing in the e-com market. And we've worked on a number of things to build and maintain that leadership, Susan. Product offering, obviously, is one. We have put our best and brightest talent on this. We are working very hard across our business unit to leverage learnings quickly, to leverage platform like product data management and IT space, to leverage the sharing of ratings and reviews to really understand what it takes to be on that first page and to get that second and third click. We're working hard to understand how to drive digital content and 360-degree spends. We're doing a ton of stuff there. And also, we're investing capital. We made an acquisition of one of the leading digitally-native brands in Kraus. And Kraus is a company that makes, I would say, more modern design sinks and faucets and the like. And we're learning a lot from them, and we're helping them be all they can be as well. So a combination of capital deployment, talent, products, IT, leverage, et cetera. This is important for us, and it's paying off. And we've been working at this hard now for five years.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That’s helpful color. My next question is, when we think about the business, you're obviously operating at margins that are ahead of those targets that you gave us at the Investor Day. Can you talk to just the longer-term sustainability of some of these trends that you're seeing? And how you think about the longer-term margin potential of the business?\nKeith Allman: Yes. We're really not changing our margin outlook for the long term. There's a lot of variability in these dynamic times. We think that our normal SG\u0026A spend of around 18% to 19% is where this business should be for maximizing value creation and continuing to invest in growth and our brands, et cetera. So no change to our margin outlook at this point. But certainly, we have demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate solid drop down on our incremental volume.\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, Susan, and I would remind you that, that our – the information that we gave out in our 2019 Investor Day had a lot of very different assumptions related to it. It was a very different environment. We assumed much lower growth for the period. So it was – I would not consider those as our current guide for the long-term of the business.\nKeith Allman: I'm sorry if I missed that, too. I was talking about our margin guide this year.\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes. We – I think the way we think about it now, Susan, again, we articulated this on our Q4 call is that, continue to challenge our businesses to grow above market and continue to have our businesses expand margin every year. And again, it's not hundreds of basis points of margin expansion, but rather tens of basis points of margin expansion.\nSusan Maklari: Yes. Okay. John, thank you. That’s helpful. Good luck.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to dig in on the Decorative Architectural side, especially the DIY demand. Could you give an April update? Are you seeing any deceleration or pretty much in line with what you'd expect seasonally? And if I'm kind of parsing out the guidance, it looks like you all are expecting DIY to be down the remainder of the year. But the commentary on the call so far has been – I'll just put it pretty optimistic, just trying to understand some of the moving parts there and whether or not there is maybe a little bit of conservatism built in?\nKeith Allman: Well, the DIY demand continues to be strong. Obviously, we've got tough comps coming up in the back half of the year. But in terms of the demand, the actual demand that we're seeing, it continues to be strong. There's no question about it. Certainly, the pandemic has increased the interest in people's homes. And we don't view the vaccine of the rollout as being necessarily a switch that is flipped as it relates from the work from home – relates to the work-from-home environment or the amount of time that people are spending in their homes. And clearly, the millennial demographic and cohort has shown interest as we look at first time DIYers, and we look at that cohort, and we expect that to continue. So yes, we have some tough comps coming up; no question about it, but the demand remains strong.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then also in the spa business, I believe you all said it was growing double digits, so nice improvement there. But could you just discuss how the backlog – the order backlog is looking? And you all have mentioned supply chain constraints throughout Mexico. Could you just give us a time line when you somewhat expect that to be operating close or at full capacity?\nKeith Allman: Yes. We're getting better, and we were starting to approach that capacity – that full capacity, if you will, as we were bringing in our Mexican labor force to a greater degree and getting more output from that. But then we had these issues around resin, and there's tightness there. And we've missed some production on some selected units that require certain type of blended resins. But the demand there continues to be extremely robust, and we have a very solid backlog. That has not changed. And as we get through this short-term blip here from the polar vortex in Texas and the resin tightness, this business will start to quickly approach stated production.\nTruman Patterson: Alright. Thank you all and good luck on that quarter.\nKeith Allman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Steven Ramsey from Thompson Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. One quick follow-up on the spa business. In the full year guide, do you have spas operating at full production and generating full margins for the year?\nKeith Allman: We're expecting strong double-digit growth for Watkins in 2021.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Great. And then thinking about price/cost and getting to neutral. I guess, are surcharges a part of that? Is that being contemplated for pricing such as resins? And then for price/cost by product, do you expect to be price/cost neutral on all products?\nKeith Allman: So we have a number of levers that we can and do pull to drive cost improvements and price/cost neutrality. We've used surcharges in the past, and we're certainly contemplating in using some of those here as we sit today. In terms of saying that every product will be price/cost neutral, there's just such variability in cost inputs, depending on the type of specific product, and I won't say that. But when you look across our business, we will exit this year in price/cost neutrality.\nSteven Ramsey: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And your question will come from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nEric Bosshard: Good morning.\nKeith Allman: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Bosshard: Two things. First of all, can you give us a little bit more insight? The deferred marketing spend, I think, $40 million you've talked about. What is that made up of? And also curious, related to that or maybe a part of that is promotional investment on your part. And what you're seeing go on this year? What you're doing across your business, so the retailers are asking for in regards to promotional activity?\nJohn Sznewajs: Yes, Eric. So it's a big basket of things that go into marketing. So things like trade shows that we obviously would have been pulled back and some of them are now beginning to come back online as people get back and some of it is advertising. Some of it is personnel. Some of it is investment in e-commerce that Keith referenced in response to an earlier question. So there's a variety of things that go into. And there's also some growth initiatives. To your point, there's some promotional activity that goes into that bucket as well. So it's a big basket of things that go across the entire segment.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then just a follow-up. Your clarity on the propane path from here was helpful. On DIY, I appreciate that the business is continuing to be very strong, and – which is great to hear. But in terms of the growth of the DIY business, now that you're running against these tough comparisons, what should we be expecting in terms of the growth out of that business as we move forward?\nKeith Allman: I'll probably think of it in that flattish range to the last year for the year – for the year.\nEric Bosshard: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question for the day will be Mike Dahl, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMike Dahl: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. One more question on price productivity. I appreciate the sensitivity around the pricing side, but anything around just qualitatively at a high level when you think about covering the cost. How much is price versus productivity? Is it a pretty balance? Is it steered more towards price? Just any color there. And the second part would be, you've already talked about some of the ways you've continued to generate cost productivity, but some costs are also eventually going through returns. So just – you've mentioned the levers that are left. Could you elaborate a little bit more on – you've obviously done a great job on productivity. Just where is the incremental productivity coming from?\nJohn Sznewajs: Sure. So Mike, a couple of questions. As you think about the weighting of price versus productivity and offsetting inflation, just given the nature of – and the rapid increase in the amount of inflation that we're seeing, it's naturally going to be more price than productivity to offset that or to get to price/cost neutrality. In terms of our productivity measures, I'll start and maybe kick it over to Keith to clarify. But our teams have done a great job over multiple years of driving productivity within our operations. And it's not just on the plant floor. It's also in the administrative part of the operations. And we challenge our teams every year to get more efficient in a variety of ways. And so we do have TCP goals for every – total cost productivity goals for each of our businesses. Keith, do you want to give some examples?\nKeith Allman: Yes. I think from a dollars and cents perspective, the greatest productivity comes from volume leverage. And when you look at our consistent and steady and repeatable drop down, say it's 30%-ish in incremental volume for Plumbing and maybe closer to 25% in the Deco segment. That conversion efficiency is very helpful to us. Obviously, there's direct labor productivity. We have hired a lot of people. And as those people become more familiar with our systems and how to work, that naturally drives productivity. We're consistently and constantly looking for material substitution and value engineering where we can take a four-part assembly and make it a two- part machine or injection molding, that sort of thing. So it's really a combination of shop floor and labor productivity, working with our suppliers and making sure that we have the most cost-effective way to meet customer requirements, so we don't want to mess or miss any customer requirements. So it's really all part and parcel of the Masco operating system with a good dose of volume leverage.\nMike Dahl: That’s great. Very helpful. I’ll leave it there. Thanks.\nDavid Chaika: That concludes today's call. We'd like to thank all you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Masco. As always, please feel free to contact me at (313) 792-5500 if you have any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

My name is Josh and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Mr. Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nEvan Goldstein: Thanks, Josh. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fiscal 2021 second quarter results conference call. I'm Evan Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Our results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO; Bret Taylor, President and COO; Gavin Patterson, President and Chief Revenue Officer; and Amy Weaver, President and Chief Legal Officer. As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our expectations are on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that of our customers and partners are uncertain and subject to change. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K. With that, let me hand the call over to Marc.\nMarc Benioff: Okay. Thanks so much Evan and we're thrilled to be on the call with you today and this has been such a challenging time. Our hearts have been broken we've heard so many stories of pain and distress across the world and for us this is really this moment is actually quite humbling, quite bittersweet. It reminds us that at Salesforce this is a great platform for change that we're really here to be a great example of stakeholder capitalism to really show how we're able to deliver a phenomenal return for our shareholders as well as for our stakeholders. And in many ways this quarter really is a victory for stakeholder capitalism. It has been not only about our core values, but also about our core products. It is about showing how our Customer 360 has been a platform for change for so many of our customers and I'm going to talk about that briefly before I turn it over to Mark, but also our company has been a platform for change for the communities that have needed us most. And I am thrilled to deliver such a great return to our shareholders and also to our stakeholders. And certainly when we look at this quarter with more than $5.15 billion revenue and our highest operating margin ever that was 20% or when we look at simple aspects of our operational excellence like the 63% increase in seven figure deals from a year ago, well really indicates to us one thing which is that values really bring value. It reminds me of a story that we really started last quarter with AT\u0026T. Now AT\u0026T is an amazing company, a leader in the communications industry and they have a tremendous visionary with Jeff McElfresh who is the CEO of AT\u0026T Wireless. And I'll tell you the thing that's interesting about AT\u0026T is they have a huge vision and that vision is that every single customer touch point, whether it is at their stores, whether it is their e-commerce, their app, whether it is getting a message from them, well and each and single customer touch point, they want to know you as a customer. They want to single source the truth. And that's a deal that we signed obviously in February and I was thrilled that this quarter we've deployed now hundreds of stores and the first 35,000 users. But I'll tell you, at this moment in time there has never been a time when we've had to go faster. We've had to deliver customer success faster and we've had to be there for our customers. And I'm absolutely thrilled to deliver that success rate you can see. I also look at another incredible win in the quarter with PayPal. This is a tremendous organization that's really it is the right time at the right place because we really need contact with payments we all know that. So to see them have such great success of our Sales Cloud and our Service Cloud, see the SPO, they embrace us so deeply and our vision, we're having a one on one relationship. The journey is so powerful. Another incredible victory in the quarter has really been work.com. This is a product that I don’t think there is a product that we've ever built faster, but never been more successful more rapidly. And you look at so many success stories, public sector organizations and enterprises that today in the middle of this pandemic everyone needs contact tracing, they need shift scheduling. Everybody needs workforce command center, try to bring everyone back safely. Well, work.com is delivery nice. Just look at the results that the University of Kentucky for example, it is a difficult situation for University to bring all these students back and work through and partner with them with work.com. I looked at so many other customers and so many other success stories during the quarter whether it was TWC or VF Corp or great public sector wins like the Veterans Administration or the State of Rhode Island. We look internationally at tremendous victories like Banco Bradesco, just had a great conversation with their CEO Octavio de Lazari, tremendous vision for the future of financial services and how customers are the most important thing today to go faster for their bank. And ultimately, I guess the most proud I was during the entire quarter was when we delivered an additional $20 million through our San Francisco and Oakland public schools bringing our total contributions to $118 million through our local public schools, but one thing is so important right now is their need to be able to enter into distant learning. So it is that idea that we've been able to do well and do great at the same time, that this has really been a victory for stakeholder capitalism to show that we can build a great company, but we not only have great core values, but we have great core products. So I just want to give my sincere thanks and gratitude to everyone who had such a great success during the quarter, our customers, our employees, our partners, all of our key stakeholders. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Hawkins: Well, great. Thanks Marc. And I hope everyone continues to be safe and well during this historic and challenging time. As Marc described this was an exceptional quarter for Salesforce. Both the company and our customers navigated the crisis better than our guidance assumes. While our performance in Q2 leaves us optimistic about the future, it is important to note that we remain mindful of how the pandemic may continue to impact our customers and our community. Let me take you through some of the results for Q2 and I'll begin with the topline commentary. Revenue was $5.15 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Q2 was the first time in which the company surpassed $5 billion in a single quarter. Our revenue performance by far continued to demonstrate strength across the portfolio. Sales Cloud grew 13%. Service Cloud grew 20%. Platform and Other grew 66% with Tableau contributing 41 points of that growth and marketing and commerce grew 21%. Additionally, we had a strong year-over-year performance by region in constant currency. America 28%, with Tableau contributing 10 points of that growth, EMEA grew 38% with Tableau contributing 13 points of that growth and Asia/Pac grew 23%. Before I detail the quarter's performance, please note that the following should be compared against the guidance assumptions we provided on the Q1 earnings call. Specifically, the outperformance in the quarter was driven five factors. One, better new business generation notably, we saw Q2 business consistent with historical trends. Two, higher license revenue driven by new business performance. Three, modestly better revenue attrition than expected and four, I see certain performance obligations within last quarter's large teleconference actions and five, creating [ph] foreign exchange. Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenue under contract ended Q2 at approximately $30.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. As a reminder this metric includes both new business and renewal contracts. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO, which is all the future revenues under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months with approximately $15.2 billion, up 26% year-over-year. CRPO benefited from new business outperformance, favorable foreign exchange, strong renewal performance and the inclusion of last quarter's large telecom transaction. Q2 GAAP EPS was $2.85 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.44. The outperformance in the quarter was driven by higher revenue as well as realized and unrealized gains under our strategic investment portfolio notably due to the nCino IPO. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.58. GAAP EPS was also benefited by $2.17 as the company changed its international corporate structure which included a consolidation of certain intangible properties resulting in a $2 billion net tax benefit related to foreign deferred taxes. Please note that this had no impact on non-GAAP EPS as the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non-GAAP tax rate which generally excludes the effects of discrete events. Turning to cash flow, our operating cash flow was $429 million in Q2 down 3% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was $114 million leading to a free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of $315 million up 22% year-over-year. Now turning to guidance for Q3 and fiscal 2021, coming off of a strong future result, we are pleased to be raising our full year fiscal 2021 revenue guidance to $20.7 billion to $20.8 billion representing approximately 21% to 22% growth. This guidance includes approximately $100 million of revenue from our acquisition of Vlocity. For Q3 we expect our revenue to be $5.24 billion to $5.25 billion representing approximately 16% growth. As a reminder, Q3 represents Tableau's third quarter in the company and therefore the year-over-year growth rate will be normalized. While the demand trends were strong in Q2, we remain mindful on how the pandemic may continue to impact our customers and community. Therefore, our guidance assumes that the revenue attrition remains consistent with Q2's after performance and assumes we deliver modest new business growth during the second half of fiscal 2021. We are taking this quarter-by-quarter as the pandemic is not over and we are only half way through the fiscal year. In that mind, from that perspective we will continue to evolve and re-imagine our business to enhance our relevance and deliver the highest level of customer success and innovation. As we look out over the next 12 to 24 months we realized it is important for us to make a strategic shift in investments today to better position our company for continued growth and customer success and this new all digital work from anywhere environment. As part of this, we'll be allocating resources to prepare the company for growth in strategic areas. This means we will be redirecting some of our resources to fuel growth in areas that are no longer as aligned with the business priority will be deemphasized. Furthermore, we intend to accelerate spend in go to market in product originally planned for next year and pull that into the second half of this year. These investments in growth are planned and they will increase our expenses in the second half. With that being said, after incorporating these and updating our revenue guidance, we are pleased to be able to raise our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to a year-over-year improvement of 75 basis points. As a result, we are updating our fiscal 2021 GAAP diluted EPS to be $3.12 to $3.14 while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $3.72 to $3.74. For Q3 GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.04 while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $0.73 to $0.74. As a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016-01. For operating cash flow we are raising the fiscal 2021 guidance to 12% to 13% year-over-year growth. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 3% of revenue in fiscal 2021 in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. Operating cash flow is expected to be impacted by these incremental growth investments. We expect CRPO to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in the third quarter. And as a reminder Q3 represents Tableau fifth quarter at the company and therefore the year-over-year growth rate is now normalized. To close, we delivered a landmark Q2 in the face of adversity and have set ourselves up for strong second half of fiscal 2021 and beyond. We are proud of our ability to successfully lead through change and above all to continue to serve our stakeholders around the world. I'd like to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, our community and our shareholders for their continued support and which each of you, your families and your firm safety and wellness. And with that, I'll open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you so much gentlemen for taking the question. I appreciate it. I was just wondering Marc or Mark, if you could show us a little bit how the progression of the quarter unfolded and just kind of what you are hearing from customers now? Obviously you did much better than what your guidance expected, but if you were to put all this in the Einstein what did it shape up versus what you were versus what you thought again, just thinking how the slope [ph] in a quarter might have progressed? Thank you.\nMarc Benioff: Well, thanks heather for that question. You know, we started this quarter 54,000 remote employees working at home. We know that we had to make a number of changes. We knew that it was going to be critical for us to reshape our company that this was a moment in time that you basically had to make a decision or you are going to keep things the way there were or you are going to change or are you going to shift. And we made a decision that we were going to change and we were going to shift. We shifted our operational values very aggressively and as we changes those operational values, we started to see momentum build. We called that out on the beginning of the call after Q1 where we saw pipelines started to increase with the second quarter and the third quarter. And it really was that as we piled in and doubled down on these core operational values we got much closer to our customers. We understood that if we were going to succeed at a moment like this, we were going to have to be closer to our customer than ever before, that we are going to have to change a lot of aspect of the company. And as we made those adjustments we saw the speed increase right up to the end of the quarter and it is just really powerful. I mean, as I said this moment is both humbling and bittersweet. This has been such a challenging time for us, for our families, and then to see these amazing results to stress incredible. I mean honestly, I just can't believe everything from just the delivery of all of our teams, the technology teams just did a fantastic job. The engineering teams, if you look at what happened with work.com, I mean it is incredible and it has been so improvement for so many businesses to get back to work safely, but now that we've brought to schools to help schools get back to work safely as well. We're doing that in a paid fashion. We're doing that and in a non profit fashion. So this is really a moment where I think values bring value. This is about us really paying attention as I said to our core products and our core values. And now that is really the accelerator. And when I look at some of the success stories that I went through and then there are so many, but one that's been very powerful for our whole company is, watching what in the third are so many but one that is very powerful for our whole company is watching what Gina Raimondo has done in the state of Rhode Island. She is going to address the entire company. You know this is an amazing governor of this incredible state. She came to us steady now, we're going to make our stage safe. There's things that we're going to have to do. Of course everybody is going to have to wear masks. So we're going to have to increase our testing, we're going to have to be doing crazy. We're going to have to do new shift scheduling. I need a command center. I need to do all these things and that our teams are able to deliver and help her and 35 other states and so many others that's very, very powerful for us because we all want to get back to how things were, but the reality is that's never going to happen. We are in the new world. We're in all digital world with the work digitally, we're living digitally, we're educated digitally, and that means we're going to have to make these adjustments. Bret, do you want to just talk about that and how the engineering organization how it kind of responded?\nBret Taylor: Yes Marc. I mean, essentially you talked a lot about transformation and research in our company, we're just seeing that across our entire customer base. And you're seeing how our technologies are being acquired, just some incredible numbers. I think one is best exam, in the past six months the use of messaging channels like text and WhatsApp and Apple Chat has gone up 600%. We saw an 89% year-over-year growth in our Commerce Cloud. Probably a great example, a great customer story, I think that really illustrates this is Sonos. This is -- and the customers of Sonos use it to play music at my house. Like so many developers of products, they had to go direct-to-consumer. They deployed our Marketing Cloud and our Commerce Cloud and they saw an almost 300% year-over-year increase in direct-to-consumer revenue as a consequence. And I think that it’s been an incredible trying time for all of our employees, all of our communities and all of our customers. But as you implied, there’s also just incredible sustainable in terrain [ph] shifts in consumer behavior, like the digital commerce and this move to go direct-to-consumer. And so it’s a great privilege to be able to help our customers navigate this crisis. And as you said, one of the key values we’re trying to represent as a company is that agility. I listen deeply to our customers like Governor Raimondo, like Sonos and making sure that we’re empowering all of them with the Customer 360 so they themselves can navigate this crisis successfully.\nMarc Benioff: Gavin, we just had a tremendous meeting with Banco Bradesco with Octavio De Lazari. We’ve also met with so many other customers. I met with one of your customers late last night in France. It was morning for them, a huge CPG company. I mean, we’re seeing so much transformation with the customers and desire for speed. And also, they’re all paying attention to their ESGs well and aligning from a position of stakeholder capitalism. Gavin, can you give us some illumination about what you’re seeing from a customer base?\nGavin Patterson: Well, I’d call out a couple of things, Marc. One is, and we did touch on this in the last call, we saw confidence builds we have to read as we went through the quarter. And the shock of closing down moving business so that it would be managed remotely, once the first couple of weeks had been passed, we saw companies begin to realize the digital transformation with imperatives, but they just couldn’t afford to put off any longer. So I think what we saw with our sales leaders is - and the products that Bret and the team put together for us was we were relevant. That was the key word, I would say. We were able to pivot very quickly. It’s a very agile performance from the company. And we were there to help our customers through these difficult periods where they have to make decisions that would typically take weeks and months, sometimes days, but I think it demonstrates what a powerful proposition we have for customers that we can spin things up quickly like work.com. We can deploy the core clouds very quickly and they deliver quickly for customers. That means they actually are relevant now is probably as high if not higher than it’s ever been. And we had a great quarter, there is no question about that. I think it’s tinged with the site sensors, the context in which it’s been achieved in. But there’s real, I’d say real confidence in the business. We’re not getting carried away. There’s no question about that. There’s still a lot of uncertainty as we look into the second half of the year. But undoubtedly what we offer is something that's increasingly our customers really want.\nMarc Benioff: Well, thank you, Gavin, and welcome by the way to the team officially. I know you’ve been with us for about a year, but now you’re officially in the role of running as our Chief Revenue Officer and we couldn’t be more thrilled and we’re absolutely delighted to have you as part of the team. Amy, we also saw a lot of action in public sector, I mentioned a few of them, but there were so many more stories. Could you highlight a little bit about what we saw in public sector during the quarter? You’re on mute, Amy.\nAmy Weaver: It would not be a call if I did not forget to take myself up yet at some point. I think the public sector has been a great success in both the first quarter and the second quarter, and it’s that type of trust and collaboration that just keeps building. I have to give a real shout out to Dave Ray, our financial [indiscernible] and his entire team. And some of the things that stood out to me were not just for Rhode Island, but really seeing the team mobilize in other states, where we have a reach out saying that they didn’t know what to do. They were struggling and within hours, Dave would have pulled together a team of professionals from across Salesforce and said, despite a new situation to you, this isn’t new to us. We know how to do this. We know how to deploy a team quickly, and we can get in there and partner with you. I believe it’s terrific to say. And I thought it really showed just the values of Salesforce and our focus on collaborating and partnering with governments around the world.\nMarc Benioff: Very good. All right, thank you so much, Heather.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope you’re all safe and well, and congratulations on an absolutely stunning quarter. Marc, I guess a lot of questions we get these days around the improvements in kind of week-by-week that Gavin just referenced around the confidence and the relevance is, what can you tell us about your pipeline and your confidence in converting that pipeline, particularly in selling in this new digital world where maybe a Virtual Dreamforce or some - how do you think about that? And then how does that set the stage? If you think about the 2008 recession, you guys accelerated pretty meaningfully coming out of it. And based on that pipeline question, is there a scenario in 2021 given that increased relevance? Is it possible to see a meaningful year of acceleration or are we just still too far from the end of this crisis?\nMarc Benioff: Well, this is such a great question. I, I really appreciate it. I guess just the third major crisis or maybe fourth that I've been through as the CEO of Salesforce. And in each crisis things are different. But one thing that isn't different is that each one has been an accelerator in the future, that each crisis tends to bring us to the future faster. And that appears to be what's happening here. Look, I'm speaking to you from my phone. Each of my executives are in their home. I'm looking at a screen that looks like The Brady Bunch with little video images of all of them, Gavin in London, and Amy, in San Francisco, and so forth and it's quite complicated that we're -- we see these continual advancements and acceleration. But you have to, as a CEO, take a moment and ask yourself, how are you going to change? I kind of alluded to that. And I think that your question about Dreamforce is so important because, I can't tell you how many people I get on the phone with. Well, where is Dreamforce? Were we ready for Dreamforce? But there is no Dreamforce in 2020. We know that. We're not all heading to San Francisco next month or Metallica is not playing. You know, we're not all going to be going in the keynote room. And yes, we're grieving that, you know, there is a grief. There's a sadness that we're not all together. We love being together as one Ohana, our employees, our customers, our investors. We have a big Investor Day. We're all in a big room at the St. Regis Hotel and Mark Hawkins is holding court with everyone and there is no such thing this year, so it's, sad. And will we all be back together again? I hope so. Am I sure? I don’t really know. I mean, this is my first pandemic. I mean, we're in a global pandemic, where we're dealing with a virus that has a lot of unusual characteristics. So we've made changes in Salesforce that we now are advising our clients to make, how to get their employees to participate. We have 54,000 employees. For us to achieve these results everybody has to be on the field and playing the game. We have to also give them the incentive to play, to train them, to keep them motivated. I think I've mentioned this before, but you know, every week since the pandemic has started, we've had an all hands call where we have all 54,000 people on a telephone call, our zoom, and we're talking to them around the world and giving them like a play-by-play for the week. That hasn't happened since we were like a 10 person, company, a 100 person company. That's what little startups do. That's not what companies who are entering the Dow will do. This is like, whoa, this is like a moment. So, where we imagine in our business also, we've had to re-imagine our relevance. That’s why we build work.com, because we realized that our customers need us to show up to be relevant to them. That's why we built Salesforce Anywhere, because we realized our customers have to sell and service and market anywhere. That's why we built the Leading Through Change Program. You may have noticed we put over 200 million people through Leading Through Change far bigger than anything we've ever done with reports. I just watched the one that just happened. It was amazing. And many other things. It is another level of enablement for example, like you know that third of our employees are reporting mental health challenges. I'm sure a number of people on this call are having mental health issues or know people who are having mental health issues in the pandemic. That's why every day we've been doing a Be Well Together call. If you go to YouTube, you'll find mental health resources. We've never had to publish mental health resources before at this velocity and this scale it is amazing or I think I mentioned you like we bought 60 million pieces of personal protective equipment, we didn't know what personal protective equipment was. It's amazing. We also retrained everyone with trailhead to become a ranger and we're doubling down on that making sure that every employee is trained. And, you know the Tableau which, by the way, I don't know if we mentioned it, I mean, who was such a genius CEO, Adam Phillips, he runs that. And I think it's going to be the best acquisition ever done in the history of the software industry, most successful certainly. And, they built this incredible data hub. If you haven't seen it you should go to Tableau data hub, which you can find on public.tableau.com which has amazing visualizations of everything that's -- and I just mentioned to you that I, just did a major management team presentation digitally in Europe. I mean, we're constantly talking to our customers in new ways at scales we could never have imagined. So it also gives us the ability to have accountability with our distribution organization, which is of scale. We're not a subscale organization. We are a scaled enterprise software company. We're able to compete effectively as evidenced by these numbers with any enterprise software company that's on the field today. And we're able to manage our distribution organization and go-to-market in ways that have a level of acuity that we did not have before. I mean, it's powerful when you add it all up, because the patient and enablement and relevance and the tactical plays and then the values that we apply, our core values, well we're a different company. This has changed us. The pandemic has changed us. We're not the same that we were. These aren't even the same players on the call that we're talking to you at the beginning of all of this. So that's really amazing. And I think that these results are evidence to that. Where we'll be a quarter from now or two quarters from now, or a year from now or two years from now, we don't know. But our intention is the same, which is, we're helping our customers to connect with their customers in new ways. We want to be the number one CRM. We're the number one in analytics. We're tightly focused. We're not all over the field, like a lot of our competitors by the way. A lot of our competitors are everywhere. They're in every market. But some of them are in enterprise and [indiscernible]. They're not just in PRM, they're in CRM, they're in ERP. They're in public clouds. I mean, we're not. We're singularly focused so that we can pick up a call, for example, like we mentioned, like from a Dan Schulman at PayPal, and he says, I need Sales Cloud, I need Service Cloud, I need to integrate everything together. We're going to do that for him. Or if we look at our success with CVS this quarter, we look at the tremendous, their leadership team was incredible. Just amazing executives and their, how they come together was -- so powerful, but their return ready product, and then the integration with work.com. That's an imagination I have never had. And the vision of John Roberts and how he's been able to show how this pharmacy can actually be a key player in the pandemic, they're doing 100,000 tests a day. This is awesome, but they have to have each one of those tests. There's an on ramp for customer success. So we have to be there with a vision on how to help that happen. And I guess another one that really is on my mind has been VF Corp. I mean, I love Vans. I wear the North Face almost every day, those jackets, [indiscernible] cold where I am. And I'll tell you, I think it's our largest Commerce Cloud deal ever. Maybe not customer, because we tend to talk about deals and then we forget about how big these other customers are getting, but it is a great company and they're doing amazing things. I also was especially impressed with how, Under Armour clipped on our Commerce Cloud and clipped off the old technology this quarter. That was really powerful. I mean, we have to act with a level of speed and capability with our customers that we've never been called on before. So look, it's continuing to unfold. We all know that. We're doing the best that we can. Our hearts are with those who are going through serious challenges. So very much this is a moment that is very much humbling and bittersweet. And we just continue to focus on businesses the greatest platform for change. Our products have to be that platform change. Our values need to be the platform for change. We know what role we play in our industry. We know that we are a light and that we have to continue to be that light, especially during these difficult times.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nTaylor McGinnis: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the awesome quarter. So the raise in the full year operating margin improvement guide is 75 basis points. I thought it was really solid, considering one that you guys are pulling forward some expenses to fuel growth and guiding to revenue growth in the mid teens in the back half. So curious if you're able to break down the components driving that guide, like how much is coming from teeny savings perhaps you saw in 2Q or expect to see further down the line and wondering if you're able to quantify the pull forward of expenses?\nMark Hawkins: Yes, thank you Taylor, for the question. I appreciate that. We were very pleased to be making the raise of 75 basis points and then that's the everything especially in the fact that we're you know, further investing to really perpetuate this long term success for our customer and serving all our stakeholder. So, I think, we're not prepared to quantify the specifics of that. But I think you've got it right. We're investing in growth areas, think about products, think about go-to-market in particular, in terms of the further acceleration and investment. I think is a good way to frame that. Of course, we're getting some teeny benefit as well, but again, our profit level is a choice and that's an amazing thing about our business model. We're making a choice in terms of where we want to strategically invest. We've shown in Q2, how we can deliver, what we deliver, which is a record operating margin, but we're also trying to balance, growth and profit over the long play. So that's our approach. I think you nailed it in terms of some of the things and we're really pleased to be able to raise and make the investments. I hope that helps Taylor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, thanks. It was a good quarter and congrats on really strong results. I really want to drill down into some of the specific Clouds. Specifically, Service Cloud, that continues to deliver just really robust growth. And obviously, your last quarter became the biggest news material cloud and that that continues to stretch that gap. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that you're seeing in there in Service Cloud? And how do you think about the sustainability of this on a go forward basis?\nMarc Benioff: Well, sure, let me just touch on some of that at a very high level and then let me ask Bret to comment as well. But you're right, Service Cloud had a record due to, it continuously grow at, you know, 20%. I don't know, the numbers are huge. The revenues are huge. The growth rate is huge. It's now larger than Sales Cloud. It continues to grow on all fronts, including year-over-year revenue growth and saw that new innovations. The engineering team has done a fantastic job. The products, that amazing velocity has added a lot to Service Cloud. They have built a lot on Service Cloud is another layer of value on Service Cloud. And in the last six months the use of messaging channels on the platform grew more than 600%. I think that Bret really illuminated that in a powerful way. This idea of bots growing at 176% pace of log per day 33% quarter-over-quarter conversations at nearly 19 million per day during the quarter. And, it's a key part of every deal we do, because when you're building a Customer 360 and you're building a single source of truth for your customer, the Service Cloud has to be part of it. There's plenty of companies that have customer service or help desk or service desk or whatever, as stoke, isolated solution, but that's not our vision. Our vision is to be able to bring together a Customer 360, because look like Raytheon P [ph]. The salesperson in the store needs to be able to work with the field service professional at home has to work with the service professional in the call center it is all interrelated. And that's why PayPal for example, is able to get done because it's sales and service together, by the way, combined with marketing, combined with all their other systems through Hilltop [ph], combined with analytics through Tableau. So anyway, Bret, would you like to come in here and like illuminate your vision around that?\nBret Taylor: Yes, Marc, I think you characterize it well. I mean, fundamentally, our customers are coming to us to build a Customer 360, that's single source of truth for their customers, so that in the face of unprecedented change for their customers, they can transform their business. They can go digital, they can integrate sales and service, it's really that single source of truth. And it's the anchor tenant of the Customer 360. And I think that's where the momentum is coming from. And, when you look at some of the deals Mark talks about, like PayPal, it is really the anchor tenant of the value proposition of that Customer 360. Another great example that Gavin mentioned in our last earnings call is Standard Bank. It's again, a complete solution for the largest bank in Africa. And, one of the things that I think is really powerful about that story is probably the most impactful calls I've done with Gavin in this past quarter was, we were talking to their executive team and the executive team all the way down is actually becoming Rangers on trailhead. They're using the Service Cloud and the Customer 360 as an opportunity to not just transform their technology, but transform their culture to become customer centric and really become a platform. They're rolling out trailers, all 50,000 employees with the goal of achieving 20,000 Rangers. And I really do think that this really illustrates the power of these stories around digital transformation, the power of customer service really being the centerpiece of that Customer 360 transformation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. I'm wondering a similar question in that being on Commerce Cloud. I know customers paid to some degree on GMV and they have to come back and re up as volumes show up. Can you help us understand how Commerce Cloud, just the impact of Commerce Cloud in the quarter and how that's driving product, sort of a holistic sale across the portfolio?\nMarc Benioff: Bret, can you can you take that for us?\nBret Taylor: Yes, Marc we saw over 100% year-over-year GMV growth this past quarter, and I think it really reflects the broad digitization of commerce. And, I think when I looked at our Commerce Cloud and our differentiated value proposition, it's two things. One is we do both B2C Commerce and B2B Commerce. And I think that when I talk to customers, it's really about all of their channels. Now, it's a direct consumer channels, it's their warehousing, it's their partnerships. And we're really the one platform that can do that. The second thing is the integration of our Commerce Cloud, the rest of Customer 360. I think everyone on the call has experienced buy online curbside pickup, right? We've probably all experienced that, many of us for the first time. When you think about the technology that facilitates that, that's the integration of our Commerce Cloud, our order management solution, Service Cloud and really that end-to-end customer experience. So you're right that GMV is a good indicator of growth in the Commerce Cloud. But I also want to be clear that our Commerce Cloud is really a part of a broad solution that we're providing to customers to really digitize their commerce experience, all the way from making that order on through the end of that customer experience, whether you're picking it up on the curb or it's being delivered to your doorstep, and those transformations have never been more important in this all digital work from anywhere world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. It's absolutely spell bounding to see, finding to see organic growth rates this solid margin expansion, et cetera. And the leading indicators are few as well. My question for you, Marc, you sounded really excited about Tableau, you made a very profound statement. It could end up being the most impactful acquisition for certainly Salesforce, maybe in the software industry. As you look at digital transformation Customer 360 help us paint a picture of what a Tableau can do for Customer 360 and digital transformation for the industry looking into 2021 and 2022? Thank you so much.\nMarc Benioff: Well, I really appreciate that question because I'll tell you that we're so fortunate to be able to acquire Tableau last year. It is one of the world's leading enterprise software companies probably one of the most loved brands. The ability to see and understand data, the ability to build these compelling visualizations like you see in the public domain, like at public.tableau.com. But I think the parts that you don't really know or that when we talk to so many companies, they've gone wall-to-wall with Tableau and doing those types of deals. That's very exciting, because Tableau is analytics for the rest of us. We were always in the analytics business, of course, either through Sales Cloud, we've had dashboards and reports, which were great, but very much about kind of [indiscernible] 49 of the sales spot or with Einstein analytics, which is incredible. But it's super advanced AI, highly programmatic and very enterprise class. This is a, this is a capability that means that three companies can deploy analytics easily. It's a simple, easy to use, and easy to understand product. I'm sure a lot of you use it, plus you can build these amazing visualizations. Plus, it has this incredible culture, this brand, this community they call themselves the data sam. It's, it's awesome. And they are an incredible group. And they also delivered a great quarter, which impacts us market talks about how that impacts us. But let me tell you, how it impacts me. It's when I talk to somebody like Bob Moritz, the CEO of PwC, which was one of our largest deals of the quarter. But it's also what PwC says, that's going to be our new analytics platform. And so many conversations with so many companies who have made the decision that now that Tableau is part of Salesforce, they see how this has become part of our Customer 360. And there's a lot of new innovation, a lot of exciting stuff coming for Tableau. And you'll see that, with their incredible, announcements that are coming in. But Mark, can you just fill in, how does it impact us on a financial basis?\nMark Hawkins: Yes, Marc. I'm happy to do so. And I also share the excitement about Tableau. It's just such a great company that to serve our customers. One of the things that was nice this quarter is Tableau in overperformed. With their offering and their particular term license offering, they had a number of really nice deals where the various customers who wanted to go even beyond one year, we call it multi year. And when that happens, so that, it further helps us in the sense of the revenue recognition. And but all-in-all, it's all driven by people liking the product, wanting to invest not in just a year, but in a couple of years in it. And the more years out Marc, the more we see that benefit in the top line. But what also is exciting for us is how it integrates into the digital transformation. So it's been very positive. It was a very nice performance for sure. Congrats to the Tableau team who's listening in today.\nMarc Benioff: And I'll also just say, well, and I think Mark, and I'll come in here for a second. We also, you know, we're two years MuleSoft. Here's another, this has been a game changer for us because it's the heart and soul of Customer 360. The ability to say to customers with authenticity, we're going to integrate everything for you and bring in all your legacy systems and put API's on top of them and give you this tremendous capability, these two companies together, this is a huge accelerator on our business that they're both working so well. Mark, can you extend that thought?\nMark Hawkins: Yes, definitely Marc. In fact, again, MuleSoft also was a contributor to our overperformance. Again, people love the product Marc. I like the dialogue you mentioned with VF Corporation, where they're buying multiple products, including MuleSoft to, get that, that 360 progress, if you will, of the customer. And for MuleSoft, again, nice overperformance, so all of our MuleSoft, team members congrats to you as well. And your contribution to this result in Q2, and when they're again selling, more term licenses this, this again, has a favorable effect on us and, and most importantly, helps us solve problems that customers really need help with. And Marc, if I might just add, whether it's MuleSoft or Tableau, or even our core products. One of the things that, we certainly hear more and more is this whole notion. And Gavin talked about digital impairment imperative, it is very clear that our products are becoming more and more mission critical. MuleSoft market is adding to that. MuleSoft is adding to that 360 solution and we're becoming more mission critical. And one of the effects Marc that that had and this quarter is our attrition rate was better than we had expected. And that's in part because we're becoming more mission critical with MuleSoft with the integration of these 360 products, and just the sheer over performance of MuleSoft and Tableau contributing to our results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats for me as well. And question for Marc and Gavin, in this new environment that we're living in can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of customer engagement in terms of deals size that you can have kind of maybe targeting? But then also, like, we talked earlier about Dreamforce, being kind of more online, like, Dreamforce was always was a big event for lead generation, et cetera. Like, how are you shifting that and, that maybe kind of bring in a little bit of the comments about the go-to-market investments? Thank you.\nMarc Benioff: Bret, would you like to take that?\nBret Taylor: Yes, sure. So, one thing that I think Marc talked a lot about is, we're really focused on having a beginner's mind with our business. So as Marc mentioned, this is all of our first pandemic and the way we're doing business is completely transformed. All of our sales engagements happen via zoom rather than being in person. And, when I talked to a lot of customers about their own digital transformation I was always trying to guide them. Don't translate your analog behaviors into digital media. That's not a digital transformation. That's a digital translation. And when we think of things like Dreamforce, as Marc said, I more than anyone else, I'm totally bummed out. We're not going to be in San Francisco in October, November, because it's one of my favorite times of the year. But we really feel like we've demonstrated over this past quarter our ability to re-imagine the way we engage with our customers in completely new ways. I think Parker made a common last earnings call that stuck with me where he said, on one hand, we're all staring at the screens, and it feels so impersonal. On the other hand, I'm staring into all of my colleagues and customers living rooms, and it's oddly more personal at the same time. So broadly, what I'd say is, our ambitions to transform our customers with the success of our technologies, our customer success teams, our distribution teams, has not changed. And in fact, I think there's a broader imperative for digital transformation than there ever has been. The way we're going to change, engage with our customers has completely transformed, and I think as a company we really think we've developed over the past quarter, that mindset of constantly transforming and reshaping ourselves to be able to meet our customers where they need to be met. And I think we have the ability to continue executing on that with the humility that predicting the future right now is really hard. We're in the midst of an unprecedented environment. But I think we've developed a lot of confidence internally at our ability to transform ourselves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sarah Emily Hindlian Bowler with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nSarah Hindlian: Great, thank you so much for taking my questions and squeezing me in. Marc, how do you feel about M\u0026A today and all of the back and forth going on around TikTok. Did you think M\u0026A appetites are picking up or just the IPO market? And then a more specific question on the quarter, look the resilience here is really impressive with the merger delivery and I understand the balance of broken investments and the commentary made, but could these better margins be a bit of a new normal given work from home? And then just lastly, I wanted to say that it's really nice to see you being generous to your employees and still reward your other stakeholders, mainly shareholders.\nMarc Benioff: Well, thanks. I mean, certainly we're seeing a very interesting environment in the markets, in M\u0026A and IPO. I think that for a company like Salesforce, we don't really see an M\u0026A environment. It's -- these are not, it's we're not in a moment. I honestly feel like we're very lucky that we were able to pick up MuleSoft and Tableau when we did, because they were both public companies today, you can do the math. We would not have been able to buy them. There's no way, no how it wouldn't have worked for us financially. So we're not in a good M\u0026A environment. I just don't see it. Maybe things could change, of course, things always are changing. But I think, this isn't part of our plan right now. We don't see that. We really see focusing on our business, focusing on these operational values, executing our business. Look, we always maintain a beginner's mind you know that. But the reality is, right now it is about our own execution. We've made these two major plays to extend and complement our Customer 360 and that's what we're focused on.\nMark Hawkins: Let me take your second part of that question Marc, on the growth and investment and could be margins be the new normal? Thank you for the question. So, we always are mindful of, we want obviously, growth number one, we want to continue to expand our operating margins and deliver cash flow. We know how critical those three are financially speaking. And we're always trying to balance that. We're always making choices with the opportunities in front of us, and we are always reassessing that at the executive suite. So we are pleased to be raising. We're always trying to be better. We're always trying to keep an eye on that in going forward, but we think we have the right balance for this year, given the opportunity, given the total addressable market that we're, so well positioned for to serve our customer and the rest of our stakeholders. So we think it's the right balance today. I take your point, and we're always assessing and we're always trying to be better.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to Evan Goldstein for closing remarks.\nEvan Goldstein: Thank you for joining us on the call today. If you have any follow-up question, please email us at investor@salesforce.com and I look forward to speaking with you on our Q3 results. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

IPGP~2021~2~239~3685~8/3/2021~-.16065584~-.16165827~-.17826094~-.17505072~-4.4608159~-3.573874~-3.7698658~-3.9482589~1~Operator: Good morning and welcome to the IPG Photonics Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Eugene Fedotoff, IPG's Director of Investor Relations for introductions. Please, go ahead, sir. \nEugene Fedotoff: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. With us today is IPG Photonics' Executive Chairman; Dr. Valentin Gapontsev; Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Eugene Scherbakov; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tim Mammen.\nValentin Gapontsev: Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another good quarter for IPG. Our second quarter revenue was significantly above the same period of last year and increased from strong results in the prior quarter, driven by improved macroeconomic conditions in most major geographies, growth in emerging products as well as, excellent execution by the IPG team. We saw higher end market demand for our core material processing product, where our fiber lasers are replacing traditional tools and handheld welders and continue to pursue the opportunities in emerging markets. We remain focused on growing sales in applications that require innovative solutions, our expertise in fiber laser technology and superior quality of product, such as advanced applications, electric vehicle battery production, medical and microprocessing. Our technologies are transforming the way products are created, enabling production of smaller and more complex devices, improving the product we use every day and bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities to electric vehicle and renewable energy industries, helping to address climate change and sustainability initiatives. Our investment in new products and the applications are paying dividends.\nEugene Scherbakov: Thank you, Valentin, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter we demonstrated excellent progress in our core material processing market, across all major geographies, with accelerated growth in high power and ultra-high power lasers for cutting applications in the U.S. and Europe and strong growth in welding in China and Europe. We also delivered robust growth in emerging products and applications. Revenue from material processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and contributed 93% of total revenue in the quarter. Sales in welding application grew significantly in the last several quarters due to increased sales of our AMB adjusted motor beam lasers for general manufacturing purposes and electric vehicle battery welding applications. Battery manufacturers are facing challenges welding together different type of materials such kind of copper, sulfur and aluminum. These materials are extremely same reflective and need to be welded with high precision and reliability. Each battery model requires hundreds of welds and our AMB lasers can address these challenges, offering superior speed and weld quality or competence solution this broad range of beam tunability and spotless welding. We also saw strong demand in emerging and micro material processing applications such as solar cell manufacturing and 3D printing. Sales of our green pulsed lasers, which are used to improve solar efficiency more than tripled compared to the prior year and becoming a more meaningful part of IPG's revenue. We are taking advantage of opportunity created by increased focus on sustainability globally and expect future solar cell manufacturing capacity to grow driving additional sales in our green lasers. We are also increasing the pulse energy of the green lasers to enable next-generation applications in solar, drilling and copper welding for consumer electronics. Revenue from our other applications increased by 5% year-over-year. Medical sales showed a good growth both year-over-year and sequentially, as a result of improved demand of our surgical lasers. Advanced application sales improved year-over-year, while telecom revenue declined compared to the same period in the prior year.\nTim Mammen: Thank you, Eugene and good morning everyone. Revenue in the second quarter was $372 million, which increased 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Revenue from materials processing applications increased 27% year-over-year and revenue from other applications increased 5%. Sales of high-power CW lasers increased 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 51% of total revenue. Sales of ultra-high power lasers at six kilowatts or greater represented 51% of total high-power CW laser sales and increased 15% compared to the prior year. Medium power laser sales increased 70% on growth in cutting welding 3D printing and semiconductor applications. QCW laser sales increased 13% year-over-year on higher demand from welding applications. Pulsed laser sales increased 45% year-over-year with strong growth in green pulsed laser used in solar cell manufacturing and higher sales of our infrared lasers for marking and cleaning applications as well as foil cutting applications in the electric vehicle batteries manufacturing process. System sales increased 19% year-over-year with improved sales for Genesis and ILT. Other product sales decreased 4% year-over-year. We estimate that supply chain constraints impacted our revenue by $7 million to $10 million in the quarter.\nOperator: Great. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham \u0026 Company. Your line is now live.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Good morning. Tim, I think I heard you say, the impact that you saw from supply constraints in Q2, I think you said around $7 million to $10 million. So, is that -- just to be clear, is that a direct impact to you, or is that what you're seeing from some of your -- what you're seeing from some customers? It seems like a fairly modest number. That's why I'm asking?\nTim Mammen: Yes. It was a fairly modest number. I'd agree with that. It's a variety of things. It's both the impact internally on the ability to supply some products and also an impact from slightly lighter demand from some customers because they can't get components for some of their systems, and therefore delaying shipments of their systems and then they don't want to take the lasers at the same timeframe they did it. And the other thing is that it is across most geographies. So it's not just in one specific location. China was impacted a bit, but also North America and even Europe as well.\nJim Ricchiuti: Do you anticipate that being a little worse this quarter?\nTim Mammen: No. It's probably going to be at a similar level. So in Q3, it's a combination of that as well as some of the softness in the China cutting market that are really impacting guidance. It's not that that is specifically driving the guidance number down more significantly.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And just my follow-up question. Just with respect to North America, you showed strong year-over-year growth. And clearly that's an easier comparison relative to the pandemic last year. But on a sequential basis, I'm just curious the decline there 10% or so sequentially is there -- are you seeing any signs of the US North American market either slowing down or potentially being impacted by some of these external factors that we're hearing about?\nTim Mammen: No. Not specifically. I think with North America it was more the timing of revenue. We had a very strong start to the year in Q1. We still had some backlog. For example, I think one of those 100-kilowatt lasers was recognized as revenue in the first quarter. So that was a bit of a benefit, slightly slower quarter in Q2. I will say that overall North American backlog continues to be very strong. And the guidance number we have with -- I can't remember -- sequentially I think it will be basically flat but again continuing to show growth on a year-over-year basis. So the backlog in North America remains pretty robust even though Q2 performance was a little bit later.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you Eugene, and thank you Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Nik Todorov from Longbow Research. Your line is now live.\nNik Todorov: Yeah. Thank you. I want to double-click on the China demand particularly in cutting. If we go back a quarter ago, I think you were talking about macro indicators showing signs of weakness, but I think your data points were strong. We were talking about strong freight agreements that were tied usually to high demand for ultra-high power lasers. If I look at the high-power sales and breaking down between ultra-high power and the low six-kilowatt we can see that ultra-high power lasers grew very incrementally on a sequential basis. Also on a year-over-year basis while below six-kilowatt lasers grew I think 24% or 25% year-over-year and about 10%, 15% sequentially. So that implies that China sales should have been strong. So I just want to double click and see the reasons if you can give us more around the softness in China cutting?\nTim Mammen: So China sales in the second quarter were strong both on a sequential and even on a year-over-year basis okay. The growth on a year-over-year basis was a bit lower than some other geographies, but don't forget that China had recovered already a significant round of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. So the comparison there is a bit more difficult. I wouldn't say I was not concerned about performance in China in Q2. In fact, bookings as well were strong. The issue is, is that I think a couple of companies even that have announced in the last couple of days have pointed out a weaker macro environment in China and even the government being concerned about a potential a bit more of a slowdown. Yes, we highlighted that on some of the PMI data that had initially come out I think in April. So there is a bit of a concern that China is a bit weaker than expected. And that's clearly driving some of our expectations in addition to the supply chain constraints in the third quarter. So I mean bookings are good, but we expect those orders to be delivered over a slightly longer time than necessarily would have been if the demand environment had remained resilient or stronger. It's still resilient and stronger.\nNik Todorov: Okay. If I can click on the supply chain dynamics, I think we heard that there were some challenges with delivering chillers that were causing some lead times extension. Maybe can you give us what components are impacting your lead times and when do you expect those to get resolved? And what are you doing to address that? \nEugene Scherbakov: Yes. Earlier there was some -- there were some components, but it's not critical components. It's -- first of all, what also mentioned that a price for some materials also increased dramatically. For example, for copper welding and also for our components based on these materials. But for our production is not dramatical, and I think we will deliver in time not only chillers, but also other product during this quarter. \nNik Todorov: Okay. Last quick one. Germany sales were down sequentially. I think European sales overall are very strong. What is the reason why Germany sales are kind of diverging from the rest of Europe?\nTim Mammen: So, actually let's go and look at the data on that on, which customer it was specifically there. We tend to focus on total European sales rather than just the individual countries there. And as you point out total European sales continue to perform pretty strongly. I'd have to look at which customer was the change between Q1 and Q2.\nEugene Scherbakov: And from other side Germany, again, demonstrated very high amount of orders for ultra-high power lasers and it was keeping 22-kilowatt and more as a first time.\nNik Todorov: Got it. Okay. Sounds good there. Thank you and good luck. \nEugene Scherbakov: Thanks.\nTim Mammen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live.\nTom Diffely: Yes. Good morning. Maybe one more question on China. You talked in your prepared remarks and said that pricing pressure remained. I'm curious if that has moved up into the high power region you had most of the pricing pressures at still at the low power?\nTim Mammen: No. Pricing -- some of the competitors are introducing product at higher power levels and trying to get into that ultra-high power market. So 12-kilowatt lasers even. And certainly the only way they can compete is on pricing. So what we call the low end of the market not just on power, but really on pricing is moving up into higher power levels and impacting or reducing pricing there. Our strategy though is really as we articulated to continue to deliver behind the value proposition of IPG's product and not get drawn into what -- it would be a terrific victory on pricing in terms of trying to compete at that low end of the market, which is just -- it's not focused on any kind of reliability or quality of devices using. I think so far our strategy has borne out pretty well with fairly robust China sales, but good profitability on those And we're pleased with the way that gross margin and even total operating margin has continued to track in the second quarter Tom.\nTom Diffely: Okay. Yes. A year or so ago you talked about using your strong cost structure to maybe get more aggressive in the marketplace. And it sounds like you've been a little bit more disciplined than over the last year than I thought you may have been after some of those comments. But have you used pricing at all from your side, or is it just in response to what you're seeing from the competitors?\nTim Mammen: No. We've introduced some of the lower cost rack-mounted lasers that's enabled us to reduce the selling price of those and make them a bit more competitive, whilst maintaining margins on that, but we're not using pricing as our strategy within the China market. It really would be a bit of a terrific victory in terms of gaining significant amount of share, but at a significantly lower average price per watt. And then having to draw even more resources to building product that would have a lower profitability on it, so, we're focused on the high end of the market. And also outside of cutting very strong growth in some of the welding applications for EV, the foil cutting applications for EV. Even some mid-power laser growth for some of the additive applications in China. And then surprisingly some of the pulse lasers even at lower power levels for marking applications, where the quality of our product is recognized have actually held up quite well. So, there's a number of different areas we're focused on trying to drive that value at the highest level possible.\nTom Diffely: Okay. That sounds great. Just one final housekeeping question. What's in your category of emerging products right now?\nTim Mammen: Anything really introduced in the last three-plus years. So it includes things like high-power pulse lasers, the AMB, green, ultrafast, UV, some of the systems applications, accessories, so beam switches and cutting and welding heads scanners, some of the telecom product advanced applications as well. \nEugene Scherbakov: And also integrated systems and subsystems based on our laser strong components.\nTom Diffely: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question today is coming from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nTim Mammen: Michael can't hear you. \nOperator:  Our next question is coming from Paretosh Misra from Berenberg. Your line is now live.\nParetosh Misra: Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe first of all on the electric vehicle, if you could just talk about how is that market evolving in North America and perhaps maybe your most current estimate as to what percentage of your sales are now going to EV? \nEugene Scherbakov: EV Market of course it's growing very fast. And you see first of all for battery welding and cutting applications different materials and production of components and some components for e-vehicles. But also you see a new tendency especially in Europe they start to produce and start to develop as a new body in white for future e-vehicles. Because after now they're using the standard. And now based on the new technologies and new projects are based also on laser welding and cutting up using for such kind of transaction. They start to produce new models based on such kind of approach. And this market grows dramatically and we see also our opportunity to participate in this by using the not only on our lasers or components of a subsystem, but also we have some proposal to produce a full production system from better for example production or some other as components in e-vehicles. \nValentin Gapontsev: Not just production system, production wise full production-wise. \nEugene Scherbakov: It's correct. \nParetosh Misra: Got it. And currently it's what? Like it's -- on all these different sales combined to about 5% of your total revenue is give or take? \nA – Tim Mammen: No. Previously we sort of -- we cut another -- weak quarter to be 5% and a strong quarter to be 10%. In Q2 it's actually well above 10% of total sales in the second quarter. So continuing to grow strongly. And if you looked at like capacity rollouts on battery investments that would potentially go meaningfully higher. I think if you look at like total capacity investments it could get to like 20% of quarterly revenue over time. \nParetosh Misra: Got it. Interesting. And maybe just one is there a way to think of your year-over-year sales growth in terms of how much was volumes versus pricing? \nA – Tim Mammen: Most of it would have been volume because average selling price per kilowatt across the -- if you look at it on a global basis was pretty stable. It was down very moderately on a year-over-year basis. \nParetosh Misra: Great. Thanks guys. That’s all I have.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Joe Wittine from Edgewater Research. Your line is now live.\nJoe Wittine: Hey good morning. I want to ask on the China cutting competition. I know somebody already asked on this, but really just wanted a clarification on whether the prepared remarks from Dr. Scherbakov had intended to signal there was more competition than your expectations 90 days ago, or am I reading too far in? \nEugene Scherbakov: You see in principle, we don't have any competitors because our product is the best in the world and we are producing the best not only lasers also other components. From this point of view again, we already mentioned in our presentation that up to now more than 20 years nobody could produce a product with parameters or performance better than IPG laser did. From this point of view there's no competition. Of course, there exists some competition from first of all in China and with Chinese production. But for this some people using combination work like acceptable quality made the acceptable quality for China, but not acceptable quality for us. Our goal to produce best in the quality product. For this product, we can guarantee a year in guarantee not only three years like now. We have impressive guarantee up to five and seven years. This is our goal. And from this point of view, again, nobody can compete with us after now.\nValentin Gapontsev: I can add also not only in China, China is damaged product, China is absolutely a lower-quality product up to now. But nobody from the best American and European company not able many of them tried, including we wanted bigger guys that try to make compete with that. Nobody was able to compete with us not in quality not in pricing. So up to now 20 years typically any new product need one to two years now to provide some similar product. And I would think unique situation. 20 years nobody not in the East not in the West able to compete IPG product in quality also in price cost and so on. We're only one leader here.\nJoe Wittine: Yeah. I mean, I don't think any of that's debatable. Your quality has proven out over decades in the channel, but is the market shifting more towards price focus – a price versus focus right now, because this is the point the cycle where you wouldn't necessarily expect that, or again, am I reading too far into just the second quarter trend second and third perhaps?\nValentin Gapontsev: And also we feel that in first wave in China, a very special situation today. Now the Chinese government – now all the policies – make in-house not by where you push the company. They will have customers not to buy outside of China. It's the government policy. They will use all major financial unions saying, they have – to stop them to buy outside. Only made in China is quite much more worse quality shown, but made in China. You could not compete with this. Sorry for the regular customer – mass customer it's Chinese policy. Now, it's not only China, many other country now especially after the trade kind of regulation were destroyed towards last year. The many companies now start to make such policy also not only the – even America claim now made in US now looking for any advantage to make – to buy only US-made product what in 20 years, 30 years ago situation. Now, they return to this situation, which was 20 years, 30 years ago, when even Laser from Germany was very difficult to sell in the US, due to many regulations which create to counter Europe to sell high quality product from US. Now, the situations return to this – this 20 years ago in the union centric. With the new quality government this throw a regulation – to relation between worldwide regulation which were creating during the last 20 years. Now they just wait.\nJoe Wittine: Great. Maybe just one follow-up just on ever topic, I'm curious on your take on Raycus being put on the US black list. I don't think there's a bunch of Raycus units ending up in the US so probably not much of an immediate direct impact on your business, but wondering if you may have any nuanced views there? Thank you.\nTim Mammen: We're not entirely sure how that's going to impact them on the global stage. And in terms of US sales it clearly does. And then we know that they are and believe know for certain that they're buying some components from US suppliers. And I mean, I think, we'll watch what they say in terms of what their impact on any critical components that they have and then how that may impact them going forward. It's obviously not a positive development for them at all.\nJoe Wittine: Great. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: And your next question is coming from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Apologies, I had some issues. So if was asked, I apologize. But Tim, what's baked into Q3 on the gross margin range? Can you kind of help us there?\nTim Mammen: Yeah. I mean, sort of very similar to Q2 in the range of 47% to 49%. And OpEx, I think last quarter guided like $83 million to $85 million. We're more in that sort of $85 million $86 million range for Q3 as well.\nMichael Feniger: Okay. Great Tim and look there's much investor worry on China right now. You guys based on tough comps, you mentioned a slowing, cutting. Tim, can you just help us understand, the degree, like in 2019, obviously your China revenue was down 25% sequentially. In other years China is down a more moderate 5% sequentially. So can you just help us to understand which -- where the market right now is getting very worried, we're thinking of 2018, 2019 where are we in that the 2018, 2019 type drop-off? Is this a similar type episode that we saw previously, where a more modest sequential decline. Just help us as the stock up right now is showing a lot of worry on this in Q3, Q4?\nTim Mammen: No. It's not a -- it's a very -- at this point in time it's not a similar comparison to 2018 or 2019 where you saw that very steep contraction and drop-off. So, we're seeing some weakness in the cutting market, but there's still a lot of strength and demand coming from a lot of the other applications, where we have inherent advantages and which markets continue to grow both in China and outside. So I'm not going to give a specific number on what is baked into guidance. But it's nowhere near that 25%. It's much lower than that impact on Q3 sequentially, compared to Q2. It is down quarter expected in China, but nowhere near like that level.\nMichael Feniger: Okay. Thank you.\nValentin Gapontsev: And you could not -- you expect -- you could not expect the cutting market will grow in the next 50 years. Each share application have saturation has peaked and ones I think are going down. Cutting market exists, 15 years huge typically much more than many are. Now trend cutting market have saturation and will grow even units down right because trend to high-power cutting lasers for one, 20 kilowatt cutting system with 20-kilowatt laser it weighs five, even 10 mid-power cutting system, five or 10 one -- only one system, new system. Much high efficiency much higher speed and so on. As a result is I can say go into high power, but once you will see work units will saturate and will go down. This is trend you -- nobody can destroy and to change this trend. So cutting to talk about, we develop new applications even cutting we develop -- for example, before for EV -- before it's now we can drive maybe 80% very, very high -- 80% started growing temporary growing they say its cutting. We're developed now with this new process for cutting. That's a very sick metal. Recorded number only seven years, five to seven years ago there was expert technical which was set all fiber lasers volume for few millimeters, which should -- may we replace it with even five millimeters. Now we develop growth system. We develop machinery which cutting to 20 millimeters is still much faster and much higher quality than plasma cutting, never before plasma cutting as they use laser for our 20 millimeters and 25 millimeters to 30 millimeters. Now we heard such process we heard them unit in exhibition and one the new distribution we will demonstrate, new machine with fantastic speed and quality or we expect obsolete machine prototype which they never -- did not even -- we're making the samples they did not give away -- without any correction now. This -- but such that now -- but one such machine we replace in this new application of cutting instead of plasma cutting, also very serious market. And we developed this process, introduced market, new application. We develop application for with the green -- curable green lasers for example, also for cutting the thin metals, so very high very production metals and for micro cutting from medical and others, it's also very interestingly new markets. So all time, we develop new yield process, not commodity like China. China maybe invest – single time dream this end. So it's not a high-tech product. It's not high-tech product. It's commodity product. We're not allowed to go to commodity with variable margin where for the – with high-tech company unique high-tech companies.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks. Thank you for that. And with all that you just said about cutting, you said about saturation cutting, growth in new applications and your view on China. Just helping to level set for everybody when we think of 2022, if global GDP is at 5% next year and what you're talking about with new applications versus cutting like how do we normally should be thinking about the puts and takes for next year, if your backdrop is what you're playing out right now and you're thinking of GDP might be in the 5%. Can you just help us frame some of the moving pieces there to think about? Thank you.\nTim Mammen: Yes. I'm not going to core drawn on like guidance for 2022, at this point in time. But if global GDP remains strong, the underlying materials processing markets, particularly with some of the growth coming from other areas and welding has been a standout performer not just on EV but in other areas, recovery and additive, ablative processes for cleaning, the foil cutting applications and even the other cutting applications. Generally, that market will grow at a significant premium to global GDP, sometimes as much as twice that amount. And then you have expected growth from some of our new and emerging products to be additive to that like medical for example, ultrafast, microprocessing applications, the systems business and accessories and other areas. So though that still gets us towards our double-digit growth rate that we are targeting and continuing to target for the medium term for the company.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Mark Miller from The Benchmark Company. Your line is now live.\nMark Miller: Thank you for the question. The strong growth in green lasers, besides solar, what else was the driver there in terms of the growth – in green laser sales?\nTim Mammen: Primarily, at the moment, the green is being driven by solar applications that actually improve the efficiency of the solar cells by a couple of hundred basis points, which is extremely – it's actually quite an extremely high increase in total efficiency. There are other green applications we're working on things like, microprocessing and semiconductor valve and just referenced now, development of much higher power green lasers for cutting and even welding as reflective materials. So – but those needed to get to kilowatt-scale green power.\nMark Miller: Do you have any estimates in terms of the supply constraints, when they might ease? Would it be later this year do you feel?\nTim Mammen: No. I mean our insights into this is the same as everybody else's insight relatively uncertain. A lot of it is around the electronic component, supply chain and processes and CPUs and things like that. So it's probably going to take a few months for us to really fully remediate or potentially a bit longer. We don't have any specific...\nValentin Gapontsev: Don't forget, now inflation growing and growing very fast. A way more and more company with not even western company, which now you in the way of delivery shipment product because waiting when the price will grow to provide higher price, all the planning to increase price for their product. Because it's a inflation and very fast, nobody can predict what would be priced through three, four months, maybe even 50% more even sometimes even 200%, 300% more. Now the many electronic components which help now happen.\nEugene Fedotoff: Such kind of components the price was more than three times, up to 10 times. Of course, it's not a big component but it's demonstrated also tendency in this market...\nValentin Gapontsev: Trend.\nEugene Fedotoff: Trend.\nMark Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is a follow-up from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham \u0026 Company. Your line is now live.\nJim Ricchiuti: To also go back to the growth you're seeing in emerging, and I wonder if you could just comment a little bit more specifically, about the biggest components to the growth in that area?\nTim Mammen: The biggest component to the growth in Q2 were the very high-power pulse lasers for foil cutting A and B green, some of the accessories I think. \nValentin Gapontsev: Medical.\nTim Mammen: Medical was there. Yes, medical as well.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay.\nTim Mammen: Four or five areas. \nJim Ricchiuti: Tim, just with respect to OpEx, you gave some color for Q3. It was -- your overall OpEx is a decent amount sequentially. And how much of that is just the layering back of some of the temporary expense savings you saw coming back into the business in Q2, or are there some renewed investments that are coming in?\nTim Mammen: Some of this is -- just the layering back expense. The other thing is that relative to the budget that was put together, our performance is above that. So total variable comp is a bit higher than a bit higher. It's significantly higher than it was a year ago. So that will probably moderate over time. And then, we're continuing to invest for example on R\u0026D to ensure that we're getting more emerging products and applications to the market than in the future growth of the company. So we're not pulling back on things like R\u0026D at this point in time. The other area on G\u0026A, which -- it requires some investment is the sort of whole cybersecurity thing, where you need to continue to invest on the IT infrastructure there. The cost of having a more significant cyber event on us. It's a challenge faced by every organization. You've got to invest in that to make sure that you harden your security and protect yourself as much as possible.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would turn the floor back over to Eugene for any further closing comments.\nEugene Fedotoff: Thank you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in IPG. We look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks and we'll participate in number of virtual investor events this quarter. Great day everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. . As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section at the Arista website following this call. Ms. A - Liz Stine, Arista's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\nLiz Stine: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us, with me on today's call are Jayshree Ullal, Arista Networks President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ita Brennan, Arista's Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Arista Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ending September 30 2021. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website.  During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the Fourth Quarter of the 2021 fiscal year. Longer-term financial outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities.  The potential impact of COVID -19 on our business, product innovation the imply of supply -- the impact of supply shortages and manufacturing constraints on our business, including lead time and inventory purchases, and the benefits of acquisitions, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Specifically and our most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.  These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Jayshree.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you, Liz. And welcome to your first earnings experience. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon for our Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. Today's call will be followed by our virtual analyst day at 3:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. We delivered record revenues of 748.7 million for the quarter, with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.96, Acare services and software renewals contributed approximately 21.5%.  Our non-GAAP gross margins at 64.9% was influenced by enterprise and Cloud Titan momentum. We remain pleased with our healthy customer growth, including record million-dollar customers and new customer logos in our mainstream enterprise. In Q3 2021, Cloud Titans was once again our top vertical with enterprise being a close second followed by financials and specialty cloud providers tied at third and service providers at fourth place.  All verticals contributed to Arista's diversity and growth. International contribution was strong at 25% with the Americas at 75% for the quarter. No Earnings Call of these days is complete without supply chain commentary. We are clearly in the midst of an acute supply chain crisis with increased prices and long lead time. We're changing our Arista mindset from our historical built to forecast in orders to build, to invest, doubling our purchase commitments in excess of 2 billion and planning for the next 1 to 2 years.  Lead times of many components have extended to 50 to 80 weeks with price hikes ranging from 15% to as high as 200% across our entire supply chain of copper, steel substrate,  second board, memory, silicon, ICS, connectors, freight and labor. Arista has been deliberate and thoughtful about price increases so far as we've shared with you.  But we have recently announced increased list prices effective November 4, 2021, averaging above and approximately 10% to offset these very high escalating costs. Customer demand remains strong for Arista products as they're gaining market share in 100G, 200G, and 400G high-performance switching according to market analysts. We truly appreciate our customers and partners for their patience and understanding as we navigate these turbulent times throughout 2022 as well.  Recently, we've witnessed the progress of our routing products with key customers and the acceptance of our routing edge use cases. Similar to Cloud Titans, carriers and large enterprise customers are deriving immense benefit from Arista's EOS and rich routing features. We deliver simplification and unified service delivery, with the support of segment routing, with traffic engineering, and EVPN, as well as rapid fail-over techniques.  This provides that ideal alternative to today's complex legacy router deployments with much more improved total cost of ownership and capex benefits. Since its founding of this debt has pioneered the transformation from routers to routing with these spine R series platforms. Arista third-generation, R3-series based on EOS4.26, delivers three new edge use cases this year. The first one is a multi-cloud edge that brings provisioning and programmatic traffic stearing,  The second is the Metro edge for similar protocol adoption across multiple edge VPN services into the Metro Ethernet fabric. And the final new case is a 5G ran edge. With the 5G edge is this aggregating the radio area network with scale-out routing. Continuing our theme of big bet wins, I would like to highlight worldwide examples of our strength with specific customer names in routing and campus adjacencies.  The first customer was CD learn an international service provider in Italy that adopted Arista for their routing transformation. Arista solution get let them to take a fresh approach to routing for next-generation edge and backbone, reducing the complexity of protocols. This delivered LTE-U and L3 services, with EVPN or on a segment routed backbone along with modern operations and superior services and experience.  The second customer was Connecticut education network, who standardized on Arista's R series with Arista EOS being instrumental in the transformation of the VPN edge, providing 100-gig density Internet rough scale stability and manageability. The advantages and the relationship with CEN across service and engineering affirm that decision to choose us at Arista. Peering between ISVs, using a 100 gig and mPES to replace them large legacy routers.  Second customers then layer and international customer in Asia Pacific, who was delighted to partner with Arista and build a next-generation Cloud Edge and broader backbone for the infrastructure growth. Arista's rich routing spec brought programmatic traffic engineering and the core of the segment routing without sacrificing quality performance of the liability. And finally, in the campus, we continue to make progress towards our goal of doubling to 200 million in the cognitive campus in 2021.  An example of this is an international customer win in Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange, providing cognitive campus for its corporate sites in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. The new campus network is based on Arista's wired platforms, the 720 - XP series, and it's built on a multi-year relationship we've built between Arista and ASX utilizing U.S. and Cloud Vision for real-time insights across all devices in trading and non-trading environments.  In summary, Arista's customers strongly endorsed our client to cloud strategy, to SILO datasets consistently, we believe we are well-positioned for the next phase of growth in data-driven cloud networking. With proactive platforms predictive operations, and a prescriptive experience. We look forward to sharing more of this and our vision and our goals with you at our Analyst Day later this afternoon. I will pass it over now to Ita Brennan, our Chief Operating Officer for financial specifics, Ita.\nIta Brennan: Thanks, Jayshree, and good afternoon. This analysis of our Q3 results and our guidance for Q4 2021 is based on non-GAAP and excludes all non-cash stock-based compensation impacts, certain acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items. A full reconciliation of our selected GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in our earnings release. Total revenues in Q3 were $748.7 million, up 23.7% year-over-year and above the upper end of our guidance of $725 to $745 million.  Shipments remained constrained in the period as we continue to carefully navigate industry-wide supply chain shortages and COVID-related disruptions. Services and subscription software contributed approximately 21.5% of revenue in the third quarter, down from 22.3% in Q2. International revenues for the quarter came in at a 191 million or 25% of total revenue down from 27% in the second quarter.  This shift and geographical mix on a quarter-over-quarter basis, reflected continued healthy performance from our Cloud Titan and in region businesses in EMEA with some volatility in our APAC business. Overall gross margin in Q3 was 64.9% at the upper end of our guidance range of approximately 63 to 65%. We can see it's recognized from incremental supply chain costs in the period, and these were offset by a healthy mix of revenue from our enterprise customers in the quarter.  Operating expenses for the quarter were 192.4 million or 25.7% of revenue, up from last quarter at a 189.8 million. R\u0026D spending commended a 125 million or 16.7% of revenue up from last quarter at a 119.6 million. This reflected increased headcounts and employee-related costs and higher new product introduction spending in the period. Sales and marketing expense were $55.8 million or 7.4% of revenue, down from $57.9 million last quarter with lower demo and other variable expenses in the period.  As a reminder, we continue to benefit from lower COVID-related travel and marketing expenses. Our G\u0026A costs committed $11.6 million or 1.5% of revenue, down slightly from last quarter but in line with normal quarterly seasonality. Our operating income for the quarter was $293.7 million or 39.2% of revenue. Other income expense for the quarter was a favorable $1.3 million and our effective tax rate was approximately 19.7%. This resulted in net income for the quarter of $236.9 million or 31.6% of revenue.  Our diluted share number was 79.9 million shares, resulting in diluted earnings per share number for the quarter of $2.96, up approximately 22.5% from the prior year. Now, turning to the Balance Sheet. Cash equivalents and investments ended the quarter at approximately $3.4 billion. We repurchased a $134 million of our common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $357 per share.  As a recap, at the end of Q3 2021, we had repurchased $897 million or 3.9 million shares against our Board authorization to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over three years, beginning in April 2019. In October 2021, a list Board of Directors increased the authorization by adding an additional $1 billion for the repurchase amount. The actual timing and amount of future repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, business requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities, and other factors.  Now turning to the operating cash performance for the Third Quarter. We generated 200% of $273 million of cash from operations in the period reflecting strong net income performance and continued investments in inventory and supply chain. DSOs came in at 49 days up slightly from 47 in Q2, reflecting the linearity of billings in the period. Inventory returns were 1.7 times consistent with last quarter, inventory increased to 575.7 million in the quarter, up from 543.2 million in the prior period.  As we continued to buffer a certain components and products. Our purchase commitments number for the quarter increased to 2.1 billion up from 1.1 billion in Q2. This reflects the combination of increased new time for many components and improved demand visibility. We continue to prioritize newer early lifecycle products for inclusion in this strategy to help mitigate the risk of obsolescence.  Our total deferred revenue balance was $800 million up from $746 million in Q2. The majority of the deferred revenue balance is services-related and directly linked to the timing and term of service contracts, which can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Approximately $113 million of the balance, up from $90 million last quarter, represents product deferred revenue largely related to acceptance clauses for new products, most recently with our larger Cloud  Titan customers. As a reminder, we're currently in a period of significant new product introductions combined with a healthy new customer acquisition rate, and expanded use cases with existing customers. These trends, in conjunction with reduced levels of upfront and parts and testing, have resulted in increased customer specific acceptance clauses and higher product deferred revenue amounts. Accounts payable days were 47 days down from 54 days in Q2, reflecting the timing of inventory receipts and payments.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were 45.9 million, including approximately 40 million of CapEx related to the purchase of land, construct a new data center on hardware engineering building in Santa Clara. We will provide more details of this project, over coming quarters. Now, turning to our guidance for the Fourth Quarter and beyond. As outlined in our guidance, we now expect to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for the full-year 2021 of approximately 25%.  This reflects continued healthy demand across all market sectors, tempered by the impact of a difficult supply environment. On the gross margin front, industry supply constraints and elevated logistics costs continue to pressure gross margins, with customer price increases as a potential offset. Based on our current outlook, we continue to reiterate our overall gross margin outlook of 63% to 65% with customer mix remaining the key driver of volatility on a quarter-by-quarter basis.  Turning to spending and investments, we remain committed to growing our investments in R\u0026D to support innovation across the business and sales and marketing to support our go-to-market expansion. Finally, we also announced today that Arista's Board of Directors has approved a 4 for 1 stock split. Each Arista shareholder of record at the close of business on November 11th, 2021, will receive 3 additional shares for every share held. And trading will begin on a split adjusted basis on November 18, 2021.  The goal of this as a backdrop, our guidance for the Fourth Quarter, which is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation impacts and other non-recurring items is as follows; revenues of approximately \u0026775 million to $795 million, gross margins of 63% to 65%, operating margin of approximately 37%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20.5% with diluted shares on our Pre -split basis of approximately 80 million shares. I will now turn the call back to Liz. Liz.\nLiz Stine: Thank you Ita. We are now going to move to the Q\u0026A portion of the Arista Earnings Call. Due to time constraints, I would like to request that everyone please limit themselves to a single question. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, take it away.\nOperator: We will now begin the Q\u0026A portion of the Arista Earnings Call.  We ask that you pick up your handset before asking questions in order to ensure optimal sound quality. Your first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong result. Really impressive. So, let me give it broad-based, Jayshree, I think you mentioned strong demand that you're seeing and I think you highlighted Cloud customers in the press release.  But just generally, if you can talk to how broad-based is the demand that you're seeing growth cloud and then what does the kind of magnitude of demand that you're seeing from enterprise customers and how do you think about sustainability of that level of demand? Would what you're seeing this year, how do we think about the screen video turn into next year? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you, Samik, for the good wishes. It's a proud moment, and I really congratulate my entire leadership team and my employees for getting us here. I think demand is very strong, as I mentioned in my audio script, across all 5 verticals, across all 3 product lines, and across all 3 sectors as well.  So, I would not -- I would tell you we are growing in that -- what Ita highlighted as our 25% annual growth -- every sector is growing. In some ways, I feel bad that I even have to rank and rate them, but if you ask me to highlight some of the growth vectors, I would say obviously Cloud Titans are back; we had a rough spell if you remember, two years ago, Halloween was not a treat, it was a trick.  And it's just come back and it is a volatile sector and its positively volatile right now. SiSo we're lver enjoying the growth of Cloud Titans, we're also enjoying many pieces of our enterprise market growing. And they really sell verticals there that are doing very, very well, not just the financials, but different parts of the enterprise. I think it's fair to say Arista has arrived in the enterprise.  We've been growing double-digits for a couple of years, and we expect to continue to see double-digit growth in the enterprise sector, and this is by far our largest momentum of all the verticals I would say. But not -- as I mentioned, a lot of routing use cases -- these routing use cases are not only in the Cloud Titans, but are obviously also in-service providers and enterprises as well. So, we're just enjoying very diversified momentum of our business at the moment.\nSamik Chatterjee: Congrats again. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam with MKM Partners.\nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask you a question on the visibility. You mentioned that certain components lead times have extended from 50 weeks to 80 weeks. I'd presume your customers in turn are giving you forward-looking guidance as well. So, can you give us a sense on the visibility you are seeing and help us quantify that in any way you can.\nJayshree Ullal: Sure, I will say some few words and Ita you could add to that. I think because of these kind of long lead times on our components, first thing Ita and the team are doing, Ita and the entire team are planning ahead. And we're normally, like me said building to forecast on orders, but really building to a future demand. Visibility becomes very important in that case, because it's normal 1 or 2 quarters.  The Cloud tightness visibility has improved a lot this year. Typically, it used to be one to two quarters, right now, it's more like a year or more. This is the best visibility we've ever had with the Cloud Titans, that's allowing us to build up inventory and to build a plan and to get ahead if you will. In the enterprise as well, nobody's lead times are very good right now and we're no different.  Although we talk and we believe we have a head start by starting on this problem as early as last year, we've several -- hundreds of suppliers and we've had to increase our strategic interface with these suppliers to -- and make again, that's on them long term. Visibility in the Enterprise is also 6 months to a year. Visibility in the Cloud and specialty cloud providers is now exceeding a year. So, in general, we're now able to plan to buy components well ahead of the purchase orders and forecasts.\nLiz Stine: Ita, you want to add something more?\nIta Brennan: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add out of this, it's hard to be too quantitative when you think about demand and bookings just because obviously the lead times and the time frames are very different. I think from -- just from a business perspective we'll continue to focus on the revenue and the revenue metrics and then the bookings numbers will kind of ebb and flow but obviously right now you are getting a lot of visibility to what's happening with customers just because we need that to be able to drive the types of purchase commitments, etc., we're driving.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answer, thank you.\nIta Brennan: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Thanks for the question. And again, I would like to echo the positive comments. These are phenomenal results in this environment. I guess my question is regarding the cogs and that the cost of some of the products you are getting from Broadcom other companies we've talked to you during this earnings season has talked about really high expedite fees, and just wondering if you're seeing those and how they're factoring into the forward costs in the business like are you able because it has visibility to set your prices at a level that compensate for what we see higher COGS unwind, maybe the early part of next year, I'm just curious whether you've seen those expedite fees and then how they might affect margins at some point.\nIta Brennan: I think everybody is seeing -- I don't want to talk about a particular supplier, but we are seeing expedite fees, and incrementing costs kind of across the supply base. And you haven't seen those in the gross margins in the Income statement today just because the mix has been more enterprise heavy, and that's been kind of offsetting this. But I think we are -- as Jayshree mentioned, we're in the process of instituting some price increases, etc., to help offset some of those costs, so that will help.  I think we're comfortable thinking about that 63% to 65% range as still being reasonable, but you will see some more volatility quarter-by-quarter just as the mix of the business. The customer mix is still going to be the biggest driver. The other cost we're managing with some of the price increases etc. when we have a heavier Cloud mix in particular corner etc., we will see some lower gross margins and what we've seen over the last couple of quarters.\nJayshree Ullal: And thank you for the good wishes, Rod.\nRod Hall: Sure, Jayshree, no problem. Just a question -- are customer -- what about the Cloud customers? Are they willing to accept a little bit of price increase knowing that things are getting more expensive? Just curious what the conversations are like there.\nJayshree Ullal: I would say all our customers are very understanding, but nobody is willingly accepting price increases, including the rich Cloud Titans.\nRod Hall: Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nLiz Stine: Thanks, Rod.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Truly spectacular. And I got to just ask about the build to forecast versus build to order. When did you implement that? And what was the reaction of some of your customers or is it more internal? And what I'm wondering is how much further you may be ahead of some of your competitors. It sounds like, it's actually maybe something that you're looking for the next couple of years if you have lead times going so long. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: First of all, I just want to give a big shout out to Anshul, John McCool, Susan Hayes, and the entire manufacturing team. Let me just step back, Jim, and thank you for the kind wishes. The traditional model for everybody has been built to forecast, lead times are based on supplier commits, there's some buffers, but most of it is just-in - time. And very rarely does anybody pay for expedites. If you look at supply chain in 2022, first of all, expedites are a way of life. It doesn't matter which  it is.  You have to plan not just weeks ahead, but months ahead. Often you can get de -commits from suppliers. There’re shortages across-the-board. There's lots of orders, there's no buffers. Everybody is coming at them sometimes and we used to think the high-tech industry is special, but some of the Cloud components we're talking about, we compete with the automotive industry and the consumer industry which makes it tougher.  And it isn't surprising at all to see expedites involve not just CEO has been heads of countries literally. That's how rough it. So, it's a very oversubscribed process. We thought we got a head start by starting. When was it? Either late last year when I trained the team put together a plan. So, we've definitely had heads. And if things have gotten better, we would be well ahead of everyone. But these things keep getting worse.  So now the head start is good, but we have to add to that head-start and hence the doubling of the inventory. And without naming any vendor just say, we've increased the strategic nature of our relationship with not just one or two vendors, but 25% of our vendors. This is a much larger, relationship pool and we're committing to them long-term they're committing to us, but both of us have to be patient and understanding of the short-term troubles we have.\nJim Suva: Thank you, and again, really big congratulations to you and your entire entity. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you. Say kudos to my team.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks for taking the questions. Two  questions if I may. Were there any 200 gigs from Facebook in any 400-gig revenue from Microsoft in your third quarter and do you expect in the fourth quarter? And Jayshree, would you care to comment on their outlook for next year? I know with supply chain it's challenging.\nJayshree Ullal: I'm just checking to see, but there was 400-gig revenue overall. As I told you last time, we have increased our customer logos in the 400-gig category from 75 customers. last year to over the first half was 150 and trending to about 300 customers, so the definitely 400 gigs. I need to double check on whether there were any 200 gigs. Let me beg off the question.\nIta Brennan: I'm just going to say, Paul, some of the commentary on the deferred is probably relevant here too, where we talked about the deferred balance becoming more Cloud Titan heavy this quarter, whereas before it has been more other verticals, etc., I think that's -- we maybe not have had revenue but we've, probably had activity\nJayshree Ullal: Just trying to revenue, so we have some work to\nPaul Silverstein: Just specific to issue the question specifically. since booking Microsoft, I assume a lot of that revenue is being deferred or maybe it's not, that's the best specific question.\nIta Brennan: I think we grew our deferred revenue when me mixed stepping towards Cloud and that includes new products.\nJayshree Ullal: So, 200-gig and 400-gig.\nPaul Silverstein: Would  give any comment about \nJayshree Ullal: We are going to at the Analyst Day how by then?\nPaul Silverstein: I can wait 30 minutes.\nJayshree Ullal: All right.  I apologize for keeping you up late, but will make it shorter, I think our analyst day will be two hours?\nPaul Silverstein: Yes.\nIta Brennan: So, you won't have to stay up too long.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: Thank you for the question. Jayshree, you've mentioned a couple of times talking about reference to Enterprise wins and that really kind of dialing up as far as momentum. But if you were to bullet point the key reasons why you're winning -- you continue to win with what sounds like increasing momentum; can you just highlight them for us because most of the people on this call are used to hearing about very dependable sales channels and many other vendors with very comprehensive solutions. Can you walk us through the key sales pitch and just what is resonating with the Enterprise customers?\nJayshree Ullal: And again, I'll do some at it, but the analyst day, but. First of all, I think our relevance in the enterprise customer has increased from data center, Goodyear, much broader portfolio that's client to cloud going all the way from campus Wi - Fi.  designs for the data center to routing and a very large  software well, everything from ACare to Cloud Vision, to Cloud US  software, as well as our acquisition of Big Switch and Awake now contributing as well to segmentation, observability, and security as well.  So, the completeness and the innovative nature of our close portfolio has helped. The second thing that's helped is our Power of One, if you will. One OS, one image, one Cloud Vision. Customers just love that, not just the innovation, but the quality and support of not having device silo boxes, but having an innovative and much better operate experience with a much lower TCO.  And finally, at the enterprise customers, these got -- we have now -- much as we talked about products, we have invested in customers. Our investment and sales led by Krishna and Ashwin Kohli and the entire team worldwide really began in 2017. This is our third or fourth year of enterprise investment, and I think we're not seeing the results of that. The first and second year and we were kind of getting in and we're just coming into the campus. And now I think we're coming onto our own in a complete holistic fashion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Thanks for the question. First, I want to say horrible numbers; you guys need to do better. But my question is can you quantify the backlog or book-to-bill or anything that might help us understand how much of a gap there is between demand and supply, and is there any risk that customers are over ordering right now where you could see an air gap in demand, maybe in some time in 2022?\nIta Brennan: Yeah, Jason, I know lots of folks have been talking about bookings and trying to put some boundaries around that. I just think it's really hard from a timing perspective. When you have these lead times, of course, you're going to have accelerated bookings and larger bookings. And certainly, we have our fair share of that.  There's no -- it sounds difficult to talk about the business I think in that context, so we're more focused on what can we deploy and we're seeing - and that's how we're running it internally as well. What are the periods where these bookings will get deployed and building our deployment plans?  And that's really what's going to matter. I think when you think about the business that way, the pull-ins and push-outs of the actual booking’s numbers and how much visibility you are getting, etc., becomes less important. Not ducking your question, we have obviously lots of demand. We've talked about the demand that we have, but these are extended lead times, so we're just focused on making sure we understand how it's going to get deployed.\nJayshree Ullal: And I want to echo what Ita just said. We're not going to get excited about backlog. We're going to get excited about deploying our customers with real revenue. And some of the backlog may materialize and remember, they're cancelable orders; some of them may not.  It's best to be responsible as a Company, as we always have been, and share with you that demand is certainly outstripping supply, no question about that and we're going to work hard as hell on fulfilling the supply and improving the supply.\nLiz Stine: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Thanks. I realized it's difficult to quantify the supply chain impact currently, but if any way to help us with the gross margin impact and should we see the gross margin step-down in the guide as more supply chain related or more related to the mix of revenue types? Thanks.\nIta Brennan: I think the best way to think about it is that we've been operating at the upper end of that range for the last couple of quarters. That's definitely a customer mix effect. It's offsetting some of the cost impacts as well, and we've been deferring some of the, as Paul was talking about, some of the larger customer revenue as well.  So, I think I should look forward, kind of outside of these quarters when the mix of the business comes back to something more balanced, I think you will see us back towards the bottom end of that range from time-to-time. I think we believe we'll stay in the range over a long period of time, but there will be quarters where we could be pressuring the bottom end of that range and maybe even break the boss.  I mean, the net range, while for vague and for four quarters, I think we can still be okay. So, there is definitely a customer element of this. There's a cost increase element to this, and we will benefit from some customer price increases here that will help offset some of that, but I think the days of living at the upper end of that range, I wouldn't assume that we can do that on an ongoing basis as you look forward.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. And not the Traveo, but like spending forward guidance, but just further price increases. I would say probably won't see most of that impact to Q4, you would expect the price increases impacts from Q1 in 2022.\nIta Brennan: Yes.\nMeta Marshall: Thank you. Congrats.\nIta Brennan: Thanks Meta\nMeta Marshall: Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks Meta\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. This is a question for both, I guess Jayshree and Ita. I just want to follow up on the Cloud Titan capex and Hyperscale capex and the visibility. I think it's fairly well documented that the balance of this year into 2022, there's going to be significant data center expansion and availability expansion by the hyperscale’s, so that's clearly reflected in your confidence. But you noted that you have a little bit more than a year visibility.  How should we think about 2023? I know we don't even have '22 guidance yet, but given the strength in the expansion in the availability, and the data center trajectory, how do we think about that? And then just as a follow-up on pricing, when you think about the 10% price hike that you're going to implement in a couple of weeks, in your mind, does that sort of more than offsets the supply chain or is it -- is there a way to quantify how we're thinking about price versus the margin impact from the higher components? Does it cut -- does it reduce it by 50%? Is there some way to think about it that we can model out going forward? Thank you.\nIta Brennan: We've tried to be very transparent with customers in terms of what we're seeing on the cost side and looking for them to help us kind of offset that. So, we're definitely not looking to increase margin or make margin on that, we've been we've been very open and transparent in what we're seeing on the cost side and looking for help to offset that.\nJayshree Ullal: Yes, and to ask your question on 2023, I guess I would say stay tuned for the analyst day, we'll try and give you a better visibility on 2022 and give you a sum of visionary statements on 2023 and beyond.\nDavid Vogt : Great thank you guys.\nIta Brennan: Thanks David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\nAmit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. And Alex on (ph.) my congratulations as well to you. I guess, when I look at your performance in 2021 based on the midpoint of the guide for December, I think you would have clearly gained some sizable market share in the year. I'd love to understand; do you think these share gains are coming from Whitebox vendors or coming more from the traditional competition that you have? And then maybe a second part of this, as you think about the next couple of years up, could you see customers that use Whitebox solutions today come to Arista and if so, what do you think would motivate them to do so? Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Both very good questions and related to each other. I would say, this year with all the supply chain issues, much more of our share gains is coming from Enterprise and Cloud Titans. Just getting our fair share from our peers in the industry, not necessarily white-box. If you fast -forward to later years, I do think Arista will have an advantage, not just in product capability, but also in the ability to rapidly supply product probably better than some of the white boxes and Anshul has often alluded to this.  So, the make versus buy decision for many of our Cloud Titan s may shift in the direction of Arista rather than strictly white boxes. We look forward to that. I'm not going to make any guesses on that, but I don't preclude that and neither has Anshul when he's spoken in the past so it certainly wasn't part of the market share gains and the growth this year, but it could be next year.\nAmit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street.\nPierre Ferragu : Thanks for taking my question. I'm very intrigued by the one-year visibility you have with your Cloud clients. And on that front, I was wondering first  impact we planned  CapEx on next year by 60, 65% or so last week. And I was wondering, is that something that is I would say aligned with the visibility you have or if you came as a set price.  And then along the same line within that visibility, how do you see the spending of Cloud Titans changing, in terms of, how it's displayed between what's happening inside the data center which is more on the switching side, and what is more happening outside today that's been there in the DCI and more on the routing side. Thanks, a lot.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks, Pierra. Both again very good questions I'll take the second one first, I think Arista 's presence for most part until recently has been intro data center. But what has been phenomenon to watch my Cloud Titan team do lead by Anshul, Martin, and others, is they use cases, have proliferated, not only outside the data center of a DCI, but routing AI use-cases top of rack use-cases, special customized use cases.  So, both within the datacenter and outside Arista is getting its fair share of opportunity to respond. And then we're doing a lot of proof-of-concepts and testing work with them. Regarding the plot Titan capex spend, we're always surprising on the numbers actually come out of because they are in billions and, of course, they're nowhere close to the percentage they spend with us necessarily.  But our relationship with Facebook takes back now at useful five-years, we have done joint development with them in the FBOSS and we've jointly developed products with them. We have shared with you in the past that we're developing our next-generation of product with them, the 200 gigs. We were pleasantly surprised, but we were not completely surprised.\nPierre Ferragu : Thanks, Jayshree. That's great.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question and congratulations as well for me. I think the one number that stands out the most to me is your 2.1 billion plus purchase commitment. And I think that's up over 4X relative to what it was exiting last year. I think going into kind of the June quarter, the expectations, whereas that maybe some of these component constraints would start to ease as we move into the mid part of 2022 and certainly into the second half, and just curious, your best assessment right, now, where you stand on some of those lead times, starting to normalize or shortened back down. And do I think that you're going to carry kind of this higher degree of visibility well into 2023 at this point. Thank you.\nLiz Stine: And presenter, are -- is your line muted?\nIta Brennan: Sorry about that. I don't know when that -- when that happened. Where did I stop? Yes. I think what the  Sorry, Aaron, can you help me with how much of that you got?\nAaron Rakers : I -- actually I didn't hear any of it. I apologize.\nIta Brennan: Let me start. We probably have two dynamics happening. We've seen a push-out of lead times again with the products and the vendor that we were managing directly. That's probably -- I think now our view is that's probably the end of 2022 before we start to see things get better there. In addition to that, we've also seen it kind of broaden out to other components.  And we're now managing vendors directly that would have normally gone through the supply chain, gone through the contract manufacturers, etc., and we're having to engage directly with those suppliers and then that's also driving some increase in those purchase commitments, and we're looking out longer with those suppliers as well.  And so, the combination I think of both of those is making that number increase. We are trying to focus on new products and products that have long life cycles. So that gives us a little bit more leeway there in terms of taking longer -- a longer view. And we'll continue to do that. But I don't think we've  the point yet where things are improving.\nJayshree Ullal: Aaron, we see this as an important investment to the business. It is a decision that Ita, myself and Anshul, have made very consciously we've got to invest in the business, and we've got to invest in getting product to our customers, we think this is an important part of our decision-making process because of the prolonged situation here with supply chains.\nAaron Rakers : Very helpful. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks Aaron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron : Thanks. Hey, ladies. Congrats, great quarter. I guess a couple of questions for me. First of all, with regards to the purchase commitments. Can you give us a little bit more color whether this is a response to competitors of yours doing the same with your suppliers? And does this lock in volume or does it also lock in price for the components that you are buying?\nIta Brennan: Yeah. No, I think it's totally off working on our own strategy, and as Jayshree mentioned earlier, we've started to do that right back at the beginning of last year even. So just a continuation of that. I think the biggest driver is obviously what's happening in the supply chain and understanding what's happening in the supply chain and just the breadth of suppliers that we need to kind of manage directly and start to deal with directly right now.  And I think that's the biggest driver of the up the change as opposed to anything that anybody else doing, etc. I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question, Ittai?\nIttai Kidron : Does it lock in just the volume or does it also lock into prices for you going forward?\nIta Brennan: Yes. I mean, when you make long-term commitments, there is kind of a pricing element to that, but that you have that price base as things start to get better, we'll see how some of that plays out, but they are obviously isn't pricing in the market today in that pricing is kind of what you're making these commitments Athens. But as time, as we've seen over time in the past, when things start to loosen up in some of that can change as lot, but right now it is the commitment to volume and price.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. As you probably remember early in my career, I was told never to high-five managements on a public call. I'll leave it at that. I wanted to see if maybe you could expand a little bit on the CapEx opportunity, which sounds like it's overshadowed by what's going on in datacenter, but just want to get a better sense of where you stand in that part of your business in the trajectory. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you, Simon. We will take your virtual high five. I think the campus business has been very relevant to a seat of the table with Enterprise customers. We're now starting to see Enterprise wins and logos where we win the campus before we win a data center because many of these Enterprises don't have large datacenters.  I think the conversations, the strategy, the ability to bring all of the silo datasets together, whether it's in your campus or data center, on the core  is very important and customers are looking to us to build there and modernize their enterprise network.  So, from that standpoint, although the numbers are still small and we're talking about doubling from a 100 to 200, we think it will be extremely relevant strategically with our enterprise for our customers and will grow obviously, in the next few years. There's also a component of channels river still pretty nascent. And most of our success and engagement to-date is direct, albeit fulfilled by channels. But we hope that will change over time and that will add further strength to our campus.\nSimon Leopold : Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: Hi guys. I have two questions. One is just if you can give us an update on campus switching, where you are versus your targets, if you said it, I apologize, I just didn't hear it. And second, I just want to understand about the accounting. Can you go over again the price increases? When are they kicking in, if they kicked it already, and then what happens with your cost of goods sold since it's on  I’m assuming it's on  like everyone else? Does it mean that right now you're still recording cheaper components, so the margins are higher? I'm just trying -- or maybe I'm totally wrong. I just want to understand the margin evolution as component pricing goes up and pricing increases kick-in.\nIta Brennan: Yeah.\nJayshree Ullal: Go ahead.\nIta Brennan: It's some combination of all of those, Tal. There are some expedite costs that doesn't end up being period expenses that we've been recognizing. We recognized a chunk last quarter; we had some again in Q3. There are other costs like higher pricing increases at such as that will end up being inventoried and will flow with the inventory, and some of that obviously will burn through the inventory that we have in the supply chain and then we'll start to see those costs.  Those will line up better, hopefully, with some of the price increases that we are passing onto customers as well. It's going to be complex; it won't necessarily be perfect. But as we look at the various different scenarios, there's a better chance of those lining up with the price increases. So that will help offset some of that.\nJayshree Ullal: And finally, Tal, on the campus, we committed to double the $100 million achievement we had last year -- this year. And here we are sitting 2 months away from the end of the year. So, we believe we will  and we will have to set a new goal for next year.\nTal Liani: Got it. And just going back to the margin, so I know you're probably going to discuss it tonight, but just in general, how do we think about gross margin going forward?\nIta Brennan: It's definitely part of the discussion later.\nJayshree Ullal: Right. I think you already mentioned -- you -- that was mentioned already, we continue to believe with the price increase effective November 4th which will really be effective next year by the time customers realize it and see it, that we will be able to offset the escalating cost and our gross margin was depend on mix. And as Ita often said, if we are heavily mixed on the Cloud Titans, we could be on the low-end of the 63 to 65 and pressured on gross margin there. If we're having a mixed on the enterprise, we could be on the mid-to-high-end, like we have been.\nTal Liani: Great. Thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks Tal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bohlen with Cleveland Research.\nBen Bohlen : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Jayshree, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you view the current technology build-out -- the new technology build-out for both enterprise and Cloud as they start to transition into 200 and 400, how you see similar or different versus what you saw from 2016 to 2018 with more Cloud Titan spilling out 100, any thoughts on duration, behavior, any puts and takes would be interesting. Thanks.\nJayshree Ullal: Sure Ben. I think the Cloud Titan behavior will be different than the Enterprise behavior. On the Cloud Titan, you're going to see a much more rapid inflection to 200 gig and 400 gigs, especially in the spine layers and the uplinks at the top of rack. And they've always been an early and faster adopter of speeds in technology, especially within the data center or even datacenter to datacenter.  We are expecting an inflection of 200 gig and 400 gigs. That's -- basically at the start of this year was very challenged with ecosystem and availability of optics and even switches the last year. The year of inflection in my view, is really late this year late this year goes well into 2022 on the enterprise still we expect to have, by the end of this year, 300 customers, 200 and 400 gigs. Primarily 400 gigs, I would say.  And as you know, our customer base is more than 7000, so obviously 100 gig and 400 gigs will continue to co-exist and live happily ever after together. But we will start to see the uptake and adoption of 400-gig in the end -- in the high-end, and early adopters of enterprise as well, like we're starting to see this year. I think the next few years can be best characterized as inflection of new, higher speeds, like two hundred and four hundred and the continuation and adoption of 100 gig in the mainstream enterprise.\nBen Bohlen : Thanks, Jayshree.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with GMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger: Yes. Congrats and curious, how is the constraints affected the 400-gig market? It sounds like you've been doing well there, but has that been a factor? And does that make a difference from a market share perspective? Do you have any advantage or disadvantage in terms of access for your 400 gig components?\nJayshree Ullal: Eric, I'd say we're as constrained on 400-gig components as we are 100-gig components, it's been a factor for all speeds. We're just constrained what can I tell you. But our market share continues to be strong in both. We're doing well in both. I'll flagship platform, the 7800 because especially 400 gig dependents are one of the most popular products.  At the same during my  and 100 gig versions of 7500 and 7800 are very popular too. So, supply-chain, is different for everything. It's not necessarily thinking one speed over the other.\nErik Suppiger: Are the optics anything different?\nJayshree Ullal: The optics is actually better than last year in terms of the ecosystem for 400-gig coming up, not different other than that, it's actually improved for 400 gigs.\nErik Suppiger: Okay, very good, thank you.\nJayshree Ullal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to go back to a statement earlier, I'm paraphrasing but I think you said you were running the business to demand rather than orders or something to that effect. Could you go back and expand upon that, I'm just curious about what you meant on that, I assume you are trying to look through customer order books and try to see what they really need as opposed to excess ordering, maybe you could just expand on that. Thanks.\nJayshree Ullal: It's actually the other way around, George, what we said is all the just-in-time and built to forecast and being extremely disciplined about buying inventory only when the customer puts and in order has gone out the window a little bit. And because of these long lead times, we're having to plan to order well, ahead of the customer orders of forecast, that's what we meant.  It's built to purchase orders to our supply chain, rather than built a customer purchase order. Does that make sense? Since there's still constrained on long lead times. So, we're making a bet that the supply chain constraints, which I hope will eventually improve, will favor those of us who make those kinds of purchase commitment. And so, we're having to get in there early and fast, even before the customer orders come in.\nGeorge Notter: Out of curiosity, do you have any flexibility on those purchase commits? Are they cancelable on your side?\nJayshree Ullal: Most of the Semiconductor components are non - cancelable, but that's just the way the business is run. We've been careful to choose components that we don't need to cancel, like picking new products and taking common componentry across them. We believe there's limited risk in the investment we've made.\nGeorge Notter: Super. Okay. Thanks very much.\nJayshree Ullal: Thanks, George.\nLiz Stine: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.\nJon Lopez: Thanks so much for squeezing me in and I apologize because I understand the same topic. But hopefully will be the last one we can cover the rest of the stuff on the Analyst Day. This has been alluded to a few times. If we look at your largest competitor, they've also, roughly doubled their purchase commitments fairly recently, you're now doing the same. The dollars collectively are like many multiples larger than either of you have ever carried.  I guess my question here is, to what extent do you think inventories actually evolving into a competitive weapon as we think about 2022 and 2023, and maybe like to what extent as in introduce risk, like if you can't get supply as fast or in the same quantities that you're envisioning now, can that influence your revenue outlook in 2022 or in 23?\nJayshree Ullal: I think there's no doubt that supply is shaping our revenue line right now. Almost more so than demand, right? I think that, that is a factor we are constrained.  So, supply is definitely a factor, I think in terms of looking at the purchase commitments, we are working very carefully with the suppliers and again, we're expanding kind of the breadth of what we're doing. And we are expanding the lead times on the length of time that recovering with those purchase commitments. And I think that's important.  Then again, we're doing it on new products -- newer products that have significant lives ahead of them. So really, the risk we're taking somewhat is tying up some cash etc., it's not because of the lifecycle of the products and stuff. It's not really an obsolescence risk, but it could take some time to burn through that inventory if things change but I think it's a bet that's worth making.  We're making it obviously in consultation and discussion with customers, etc. But it is a longer lead time and then a broader set of suppliers than we'd normally carry. That's why you're seeing that big uptick. We're not only doing it for the components that we used to offer in the past directly, but we're also now doing it for components that would have come to us through the CMs in a normal supply environment.\nJon Lopez: Understood. Okay, thanks for the thoughts.\nJayshree Ullal: Okay, thank you very much.\nLiz Stine: This concludes the Arista Q3 2021 earnings call. We have posted a presentation which provides additional information on our fiscal results, which you can access on the Investor section of our website.

Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kiley and good afternoon, everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered outstanding results again this quarter. For the third quarter, net sales increased 28.6% to a record $2 billion. Operating profit increased to 14.2% of sales and diluted EPS increased to $3.94 per share. In addition to producing these excellent financial results, we also delivered strong operational results. We continue to increase our market share in Prestige Beauty based on dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, compared to the same period last year. We increased the number of members in our Ultimate Rewards loyalty program by 13% to a record 35.9 million members and returned to pre-pandemic member penetration levels. And we navigated global supply chain challenges and tight labor markets and remained well positioned to meet guest needs and deliver a successful holiday season. This performance reflects the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, the power of Ulta Beauty's differentiated model and the impact of our winning culture and outstanding team. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their incredible efforts to serve our guests and deliver these excellent results. I'm inspired every day by our associates' passion for beauty and passion for our guests and I am honored to lead such a great company of talented associates who continue to care for each other while driving our business forward. At our Analyst Day in October, we introduced a new strategic framework which will shape our future and enable Ulta Beauty to deliver against longer-term financial targets. Today, I'll reiterate some of the information we discussed about our strategic imperatives and share an update on progress made in the third quarter, then I'll share how we are positioning Ulta Beauty for holiday before I turn it over to Scott to discuss the financials. Starting with our focus on driving breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Our differentiated assortment is core to our success. And we continue to innovate, evolve and expand our offering to excite the beauty enthusiast. In the third quarter, all major categories delivered robust double-digit comp growth compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by cycling last year's disruption from COVID, product newness and strong performance from our strategic promotional events, including 21 Days of Beauty, Ahava  and our Gorgeous Hair event. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, fragrance, bath, haircare and skincare all delivered strong double-digit comp growth. While makeup was slightly below 2019 levels, we are encouraged that the trend in Prestige Makeup improved from the second quarter and growth in mass cosmetics remained strong. Engagement with the category remains high with consumers looking to refresh their beauty stash with new products and recent trends give us confidence the makeup category will return to growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. Compared to last year, eyes, face and lip continued to deliver strong growth within the makeup category. Engagement with false lashes and lash growth serums, combined with innovation like creamy eye shadow sticks, are driving continued growth within eye. Increased interest in tinted moisturizers and blush are driving growth within face. And lip color, lip gloss and lip balm continue to drive growth within lip. Newness continues to excite and engage guests. New brands like Bobby Brown and Elaluz, combined with new product launches from a wide range of brands, including ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte and NYX drove nice growth in the quarter. In addition, this quarter, we expanded MAC into 200 additional stores. Haircare delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by strong guest engagement with our strategic events, newness and our Back Bar Takeover events. In early October, we kicked off our fall Gorgeous Hair event, a semiannual event strategically focused on acquiring members who do not shop the haircare category or engage with our salon services. Building on the success of our spring event, we continue to streamline offers, focus our marketing events and create relevant storytelling around hair goals, service enhancements and holiday kits. We saw good growth from our core assortment and engagement with new brands like KRISTIN ESS, Briogeo and Verb. And product newness from brands like Dyson, Living Proof, Redken and Curlsmith continued to resonate with guests. We continue to expand our assortment of prestige haircare brands and I'm excited to share we will launch OLAPLEX, the number one prestige hair brand in the market, in all Ulta Beauty stores and on ulta.com in January. Our Back Bar Takeovers give our stylists the unique opportunity to introduce new brands and products to guests. And this quarter, salon takeovers by Bondi Boost, IGK, Verb and KRISTIN ESS all drove nice sales growth during their respective takeovers. Skincare delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth as guests continue to invest in self-care and maintain their skincare regimens. Similar to last quarter, skincare routines, including moisturizers, serums and cleansers, drove category growth. New brands, including Drunk Elephant; Fresh; Good Molecules which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and peach slices; as well as new products from Tula, Clinique and The Ordinary drove solid guest engagement. Finally, our fragrance and bath category continued to deliver exceptional growth. Ariana Grande's latest fragrance, God is a Woman which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty; as well as newness from Carolina Herrera; Coach; YSL and Dior, drove strong growth during the quarter. Events included in our back-to-school gift with purchase and our monthly Fragrance Crush program also drove strong engagement. Beyond fragrance, the bath and body category continues to drive robust growth as moisturizers and scrubs remain on trend. In addition to delivering growth from our core categories, we are focused on driving growth from key cross-functional platforms. Starting with Conscious Beauty, our cross-category initiative intended to help guests discover and engage with brands and products which reflect their personal values. Through this program, we identify brands across five key pillars: clean ingredients, cruelty free, vegan, sustainable packaging and positive impact. During the quarter, we certified 19 new brands, including LAMIK Beauty, WLDKAT and Better Not Younger, bringing the total number of certified conscious beauty brands to 275 at the end of Q3. During the third quarter, we expanded our certification to the SKU level for clean ingredients and vegan and added in-store badging at the shelf for certified brands as well as new search filters online to help guests easily identify products which reflect what is most important to them. Moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added two new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I am excited to share that we have welcomed our first South Asian owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also .\nOperator: \nDave Kimbell: Hello, everyone. I think we're having -- we had a -- we were disconnected. I think we're having some phone network issues. But hopefully, you can hear me and I'm going to pick up, I think, where we got cut off. So if I repeat a little bit, I apologize but we'll dive right back in. So moving now to our efforts to expand our assortment of black-owned and BIPOC brands. During the third quarter, we added two new black-owned brands, Sunday || Sunday and Nude Sugar and we are on track to double the number of black-owned brands in our assortment this year. In addition, I'm excited to share we have welcomed our first South Asian-owned makeup brand to the Ulta Beauty family, Live Tinted. Founded by Asian influencer, Deepica Mutyala, Live Tinted is a cosmetic brand that celebrates multicultural beauty. The brand is also a part of our conscious beauty platform certified as clean, vegan and cruelty-free. Based on our proprietary research, we know 65% of beauty enthusiasts believe beauty is significantly connected to wellness. Reflecting this consumer insight, in the second quarter, we launched the wellness shop online and in 450 stores. This cross-category platform offers self-care products for the mind, body and spirit in an accessible, easy-to-navigate way. In the third quarter, we refreshed the wellness shop assortment shifting from summer solutions to total body care and hydration which is especially relevant during colder months and introduced new items from HAIRtamin, Alum, OSEA and Josie Maran . Turning now to our efforts to evolve the guest experience through our personalized and connected omnichannel ecosystem, All in Your World. We know the guest journey is increasingly blurring across physical and digital channels and we aim to deliver a cohesive omnichannel strategy to serve our guests. During Q3, we enhanced our omnichannel strategy in four ways. First, we launched Beauty to Go, our promise that buy online, pick up in store orders will be picked up and ready to go within two hours or less, giving our guests fast, convenient access to the beauty they want most. We also continue to test incentive strategies to encourage guest utilization. During the third quarter, BOPIS orders increased 28% compared to last year, totaling 20% of e-commerce sales in the quarter compared to 16% last year. Second, partnering with DoorDash, we launched same-day delivery in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Boise and we're excited about the value and convenience that will provide guests this holiday season. Third, in October, we launched two exclusive salon services in all stores and relaunched skin services in select stores. Starting with salons. We have partnered with OLAPLEX to offer guests a professional bond repair service which reverses damage caused by hair color, chemical treatment, heat and styling and the environment. And we have partnered with Redken to introduce a new express root touch-up service that offers guests 100% gray coverage color in only 10 minutes. These new exclusive services are bringing new guests into our salon. We also relaunched skin services in 100 locations featuring a revamped menu with new services to address specific guest concerns, such as hydration, anti-aging and acne. While it's still early, we are pleased with how guests are engaging with these new offerings. Finally, we launched Ulta Beauty at Target in 92 stores and online during the third quarter and I am pleased to share we have reached our fiscal year goal of opening more than 100 shops. We are excited about this innovative partnership and how, together with Target, we will change the way guests experience beauty. While it will take time for us to understand what role this new distribution point will play for our guests, we are incredibly pleased with the ongoing customer excitement and encouraged to see Ultimate Reward members linking their accounts with Target Circle as well as new members signing up through the shop. Moving on to our efforts to expand and deepen our presence across the guest beauty journey as the heart of the beauty community. We are focused on how to best elevate consumer connection, supercharge, member acquisition and drive guest loyalty, love and share of wallet. In the third quarter, we continue to elevate our storytelling with relevant content across channels to launch Ulta Beauty at Target and to support our strategic events. In addition, as students return to classrooms after more than a year of virtual learning, we saw an opportunity to deepen our engagement with Gen Z audiences across channels with insight-driven campaigns during key back-to-school moments. We ended the third quarter with 35.9 million active members, 13% above last year and 6% above 2019. While we continue to add new members, member growth this quarter was largely driven by a reactivation of lapsed members and active member retention. After experiencing headwinds last year due to the disruption from the pandemic, we have accelerated personalization to create stronger life cycle strategies, build baskets and maximize business returns and we are very pleased with the results. We are driving strong conversion of new members in stores and online. We are successfully reengaging members who lapsed during the pandemic and we are driving stronger engagement from our existing members. Importantly, our member retention rates have recovered to pre-pandemic levels and spend per member is at an all-time high. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. Based on our consumer insights, we expected many guests would start their holiday shopping earlier this year and we proactively took steps to ensure we were ready with holiday sets, stocking stuffers and unique collaborations to help guests get a head start on their gifting needs. If holiday 2020 was about less, holiday 2021 is about more, more fun, more in real life gatherings, more gifting and more glamming. All of our teams at Ulta Beauty are ready and excited to help our guests celebrate more this year. Like last year, we kicked off the holiday season in early November with our Hello Holidays campaign, early Black Friday deals and new loyalty offers. With authentic stories of connection and joy across video, digital, social and print platforms to encourage and motivate beauty enthusiasts to shop Ulta Beauty, we'll be everywhere our guests are this holiday season. Our merchant teams have built an outstanding holiday assortment with giftable fun items across categories and price points. With new brands like Bobby Brown, Drunk Elephant and Briogeo, expanded assortments from brands like Laura Mercier, Florence and Pattern and exciting holiday offerings from brands like Dyson, Tarte, Ariana Grande, Truly and our very own Ulta Beauty Collection, we have great gifts for everyone. To help guests explore our best holiday gifts, we developed a unique digital experience to allow for easy discovery of holiday gifts online and in-store. When guests visit ulta.com or scan the QR codes on a banner at the front of our store, an app click will launch giving the guest an opportunity to easily explore top gifts by category. Our stores are always the center of holiday at Ulta Beauty. As we combine our great in-store experience with our innovative omnichannel capabilities, we'll meet every guest wherever and however they want to shop Ulta Beauty. To help guests get ready for in real-life celebrations, we've expanded salon capacity to 100% in all Ulta Beauty salons and benefit brow bars except where limited by state or local mandates and we've relaunched skin services in select stores. Finally, our BOPIS, curbside and same-day delivery options, will provide guests with great shopping convenience this holiday season. Our teams are excited, engaged and ready to support our guests from proactively managing inventory flow and anticipating supply chain challenges to stress testing our IT systems and digital platforms to successfully accelerating our holiday hiring. The holiday season is off to a strong start and I am confident we are well positioned to deliver another successful holiday season at Ulta Beauty. In closing, we are excited about the strength we are seeing in our business. Our third quarter performance exceeded our initial expectations and we are encouraged by the early holiday trends. The beauty category is recovering and our teams are executing well. We are investing and innovating to ensure Ulta Beauty will lead the new beauty landscape and we are confident our well-defined strategy will enable us to capture more market share and drive profitable growth. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?\nScott Settersten: Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results and I would like to echo Dave's comments and express my appreciation to all our Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another outstanding quarter. Starting with the income statement. Q3 sales increased 28.6% driven by double-digit growth in comp sales and strong new store performance. Total company comp increased 25.8% primarily driven by strong transaction growth in stores. In addition to robust sales growth from stores, e-commerce exceeded our expectations delivering modest growth on top of last year's 90% growth. Total company transactions for the quarter increased 16.8%. Average ticket increased 7.7%, primarily due to an increase in average selling price, reflecting favorable category mix shifts and lower promotional levels. During the quarter, we opened seven new stores and closed one store. We also remodeled three stores and relocated two stores. Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, total sales increased 19% and comp sales increased 14.3%. From a mix perspective, makeup was 45% of sales compared to 47% last year. Haircare products and styling tools were 21% of sales compared to 20% last year. Skincare was 16% of sales, flat with last year. And the fragrance and bath category increased 200 basis points to 12% of sales. Q3 gross profit margin increased 450 basis points to 39.6% of sales compared to 35.1% last year. The increase was primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, channel mix shifts, leverage of salon expenses and higher margin merchandise margin. Consistent with what we experienced in the first half of this year, strong top line growth and benefits from our occupancy cost optimization efforts resulted in significant leverage of fixed costs. E-commerce sales penetration in Q3 was about 500 basis points lower than last year as we cycled last year's strong e-commerce growth. As a percentage of sales, salon expenses also leveraged, reflecting strong top line sales and lower costs from the elimination of the salon manager role. As a reminder, we will anniversary this change in Q4. The improvement in merchandise margin was primarily the result of higher sales, lower promotional activity and ongoing benefits from our category management efforts. Comparing this year's performance to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin improved by 250 basis points. Higher merchandise margin, fixed cost leverage and leverage of salon expenses were partially offset by adverse channel mix. As a percentage of sales, SG\u0026A decreased to 25.2% and compared to 26.8% last year. Strong top line growth drove leverage of corporate overhead, store expenses and store payroll and benefits. This leverage was partially offset by deleverage from marketing expense, primarily reflecting increased spend on print advertising compared to the third quarter last year. Last year, we significantly reduced our spend on print material in Q3 due to the pandemic. This year, our cadence of print was more normalized. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we are leveraging our CRM capabilities to optimize circulation and increase the profitability of our print vehicles. Compared to Q3 of fiscal 2019, SG\u0026A as a percentage of sales was about 150 basis points favorable. As a percentage of sales, lower store expenses, store payroll and benefits and corporate overhead were partially offset by higher marketing expense. Operating margin was 14.2% of sales compared to 6.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on a GAAP basis and 8% of sales on an adjusted basis. Strong top line growth driven primarily by stores, combined with the impact of our ongoing cost optimization efforts, including promotional optimization, delivered strong operating margin results. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.1% compared to 25.1% in the third quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable provision to tax return adjustments driven by federal employment tax credits compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased to $3.94 compared to $1.32 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in Q3 of last year was $1.64. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of inventory compared to $1.4 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 40 additional stores, the increase in inventory reflects our proactive efforts to mitigate holiday sales risk due to anticipated supply chain disruptions. Where appropriate, our teams work closely with our brand partners to prioritize receipts to ensure we have adequate inventory of core and seasonal product to support expected demand for the holiday season. Capital expenditures were $51.1 million for the quarter, driven by investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, supply chain and IT systems. Depreciation was $65.2 million compared to $72.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's store impairments and store closures. We ended the quarter with $605.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we repurchased 341,000 shares at a cost of $126.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $759.8 million remaining under our current $1.6 billion repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately 850 million of shares in fiscal 2021 but as always, have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions. Turning now to our updated outlook for 2021. We are very pleased with our year-to-date results through Q3 and are encouraged by the strong trends we've experienced so far in the fourth quarter. However, we recognize we still have several significant sales weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. Despite these uncertainties, we have increased our financial expectations for the year. We now expect net sales for the year will be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion with comp sales growth forecasted in the 36% to 37% range. This guidance reflects our expectation that fourth quarter comp growth will be between 15% and 20%. For the year, we plan to open approximately 44 net new stores and remodel or relocate 17 stores. We now expect operating margin rate for fiscal 2021 will be between 14.3% and 14.5% of sales. We continue to believe the largest driver of our operating margin expansion will come from gross margin, driven by leverage of fixed costs, less headwind from channel shift, improving merchandise margin and leverage of salon costs. Based on higher top line growth, we now expect to leverage SG\u0026A more than previously expected as compared to fiscal 2020. Based on these assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share will be between $16.70 and $17.10 per share, including the impact of approximately $850 million in share repurchases. We now expect to spend between $200 million and $225 million in CapEx in fiscal 2021, including approximately $100 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $80 million for supply chain and IT and about $34 million for store maintenance and other. As a reminder, our guidance for fiscal 2021 assumes a consistent federal tax rate and no material increases in the federal minimum wage. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to address a few follow-up questions we received from our October Analyst Day event. First, our longer-term financial targets. In October, we shared targets for revenue and earnings growth which we are confident we can deliver through fiscal 2024 based on the limited visibility we have in the dynamic operating environment. As a reminder, we are targeting net sales growth between 5% and 7% and diluted earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range on a compound annual growth basis using fiscal 2019 as base through fiscal 2024. In addition, we are targeting operating profit margins in the 13% to 14% range over the next three years. Our operating margin expectations reflect a balanced and disciplined approach to strategic investments that will support our long-term growth aspirations and deliver strong shareholder returns. Regarding the timing of investments related to Project SOAR, our multiyear effort to upgrade our enterprise resource planning or ERP platform. We expect to invest $160 million to $180 million in capital over the next three years, with most of the investment planned for fiscal 2022 and 2023. As a reminder, in addition to providing us with more flexible and scalable operating environment, this new platform will support future growth and innovation. We expect to begin to see operational benefits from this investment in fiscal 2023. Lastly, we are still finalizing our budget for fiscal 2022 and plan to provide financial guidance in line with our regular cadence on our March earnings call. However, we wanted to share some initial thoughts to consider as you update your financial models. Comp sales growth in fiscal 2021 is expected to be significantly stronger than we initially planned but we remain confident we can deliver comp sales growth in fiscal 2022 within our longer-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. While we expect fiscal 2021 operating margin will be modestly above our longer-term target, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2022 will be within our longer-term targeted range of 13% to 14%, reflecting a more normalized pace of top line growth and capital and operational investment. We continue to target EPS growth in fiscal 2022 despite the challenge of cycling this year's stimulus payments and reopening of the economy but acknowledge the earnings growth rate next year will likely be lower than our longer-term target. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q\u0026A session.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. At the time that you provided your longer-term guidance, you were expecting to have a 13% operating margin this year. You're now on pace to have the mid-14% operating margin and yet you still expect your operating margin to be within your guidance for next year. So will you be investing more than you had originally planned for 2022? And as part of that, if you do better than the 3% to 5% sales -- comp sales increase that you're anticipating for next year, would you let that flow to the bottom line and have better-than-expected margins?\nScott Settersten: Yes. So to the first part of your question, Michael, what we're talking about today is consistent with how we framed it up at our Analyst Day in the later part of October. So again, over the longer term, we're very confident we can deliver operating margin in the 13 to 14 percentage range. We, again, reiterated today, that's a function of what we expect to be a more moderate top line sales growth environment next year, coupled with a more normalized investment cycle for the company and that's with people cost and all the capital costs that go along with all those new great strategic initiatives that we have well underway now. So as we think about potential sales overperformance next year which, again, we would hope to see that, we would continue to take what we always have as a very disciplined, pragmatic approach to long-term investment to drive healthy growth in the business balanced against short-term operating results. So again, just making sure we take a very balanced approach to that as we have in the past and you can expect that to continue into the future.\nDave Kimbell: And Michael, I'd just add to what Scott said, just to reiterate what we talked about at Analyst Day that we are very optimistic about the path ahead. That's reflected in that long-term guidance. We believe we'll be growing faster than the market. The initiatives, both in our core business today as well as new programs and initiatives that we'll be adding over next year and the years ahead, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be leading the category and delivering profitable growth over that time frame. And as we shared at Analyst Day, we see a lot of confidence in that path ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you. And have a great holiday.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the comments you made around cosmetics. Are you seeing any newness that you're excited about? And what do you think will be the catalyst to move the comp into positive territory versus 2019?\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Lorraine. Yes, makeup, obviously, is an important topic for us and one that we're very focused on and I'd reiterate our confidence in the category. It is -- as I said in the remarks, it is not performing at the level that our other categories, skincare, haircare, bath, fragrance which are all delivering double-digit comp versus 2020. It has not caught up to that level of growth. But even with that, we feel encouraged by what we're seeing. Our mass side of the business remains double-digit growth versus 2019 and is performing well. And our prestige business improved in the quarter and we saw some real pockets of growth and success. And I think it's a combination of things, both currently driving the business and as we look forward. We continue to see strong innovation and growth from a number of brands, brands across the spectrum from Clinique and NARS and Lancôme to NYX and Maybelline. We're expanding MAC into 200 additional stores to have it in over 500 of our stores. We've launched new brands like Bobby Brown and we're seeing newness from Laura Mercier, ColourPop, Urban Decay, Tarte. And so it is -- there's a robust pipeline and it's hitting across all price points. When I look at some of the trends that we see in the market and we believe will drive the business into next year. There's a number of things that, again, encourage us. We see really a duality of looks that's going on right now, a combination -- many consumers looking to a combination of both natural looks and bolder looks. Looks, the bolder looks that reflect kind of this idea of individual expression, bold colors with innovation, innovative formulas, color boost that bright impactful, particularly around the eye. And that's -- that combination of people looking to do both, natural and bolder colors, is really positive. We've talked about skinification for a while, bringing moisturizing benefits or lightweight concealers or other elements that combine those categories. There's evolved application techniques, including what we kind of see as kind of next generation of contouring that's been driven by TikTok and other social media which we think is encouraging. New product forms, including long wear lip. We've been looking at inclusive beauty for a while and that's continuing to drive across all different types of skin tones, again, driven by influence and TikTok. And mascara and lashes is another space I've mentioned that we're seeing innovation and growth. A combination of both using more -- with more than one product or having different mascaras for different events and different times a day. So a number of things that are coming together that are helping improve the category and give us confidence as we look forward. So as we look at the -- both the trend impact in the total category and the pipeline that we have, both of existing brands and new brands on the horizon in 2022, we feel confident in the path ahead and are working every day to drive that business forward.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, everyone. Happy Holidays. Dave, I want to ask about OLAPLEX. Would you be willing to share with us how it could stack up relative to some of the prior big launches? Maybe Kylie. I wrote down Clinique and Lancôme. You also considered getting into pro hair color. And then this is Part 3 but I assume you're not going to give this product to Target right away but curious how that works.\nDave Kimbell: Well, yes, I'm not going to give you real, like, exact specifics of how any one launch would match up with others, other than to say we're thrilled about our partnership with OLAPLEX. We're already in partnership. We have been for several weeks now with our salon service and that's performing exceptionally well, exceeding our expectations. Our guests are thrilled by it. And importantly, our stylist are thrilled by it. And so it's -- that's gotten out of the gates really strong. And as we move into January to be able to launch the product line in all stores, in online, a complete assortment of OLAPLEX. As I mentioned in the remarks and you know it's the number one prestige haircare brand and so we anticipate that it will have a big impact on our hair business and continue to support and drive our salon business. So we're excited about it and we're putting the unique capabilities of Ulta Beauty behind the launch, a real 360 marketing program, leveraging our almost 36 million members and all the marketing tools and capabilities and partnership with just a fantastic OLAPLEX team. So excited about that launch and looking forward to taking the next step of that in January. And then, as far as other -- extending into Target, we look at every brand and every opportunity and nothing here to specifically talk about as it relates to OLAPLEX. But Target is -- we're excited about and we'll continue to evolve that assortment over time.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nMatthew Norton: Hey, Matt Norton on for Steve Forbes here. I wanted to ask about the Target partnership. We know it's early but wanted to ask if you guys have seen any categorical differences, any customer demographic differences, spend for member frequency? Anything of that nature would be helpful.\nKecia Steelman: I'll take that with one, Matt. This is Kecia. It's really too early to comment on the results as we really want to see a few purchase cycles to confirm the role of this new addition, how it plays for our guests. We think about purchase cycle similar to what we see with our members who really typically shop Ulta Beauty 3x to 4x a year. So it's going to take a little bit more time because we just opened these stores at the beginning of August. Longer term, we do believe this partnership is going to really enable us to expand our loyalty members, increase our engagement, ultimately increase our spend per member. But bottom line, our partnership brings together these two powerhouse retailers to really reimagine prestige. We're really off to a strong start. We're excited to see what the holiday season brings but we'll be able to update you after a few more shopping cycles here.\nMatthew Norton: Thanks. Good luck for the holiday period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Crédit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nMichael Binetti: Hey guys, thanks for taking our question here. Scott, can we talk a little bit more about the gross margin? You helped us a lot with some of the drivers there in merch margin, the fixed cost leverage, salon leverage and I think you said a little bit of an offset from the channel mix headwinds. But you gave some comments on the merch margin as well. But as we think of where you are today, are there elements there that you're seeing in the gross margin this year that are -- that help you form a new baseline to grow off of going forward? Or would you point us to some of those elements that you think you need to give back? And I know you've done a lot of work on things like promotional levels and merch margin. You just told us the revenues will grow, so maybe there should be some fixed cost leverage still next year. I'm just wondering, as we take your comments and try to put them out to '22, if there's things we should think about as offsets there as well?\nScott Settersten: Yes, I don't think there's anything incrementally new, I guess, I could share. It's really a combination of all the variables that we've been talking about with investors and with the analyst for quite some time. So it all kind of gets back to our EFG efforts, right? So a lot of great work has been done by our teams over the last couple of years across a wide variety of cost targets across our business. We talked about occupancy costs. We've been talking about promotional effectiveness. We've been talking about core end-to-end process opportunities. We've been talking about supply chain investments for the future. So there's a lot of variables at play here. We're -- I think, producing very good results this year under very difficult circumstances. So all this good work now is starting to bear fruit for us. So again, I would say those are the building blocks that we start with as we started thinking about our longer-term plan. And then as you heard us describe at Analyst Day, now we're into 2.0, I guess, I would call it, with our continuous improvement initiatives, right? And so building highly skilled resources internally here that can help us get after some of those harder to capture benefits. And of course, some of the new infrastructure investments that we talked about as well at Analyst Day, especially in Project SOAR which is really a multigenerational opportunity for us to reimagine business flows across the business and improve our processes and take a lot of inefficiencies out of the business here. But again, some of that takes time. So as we're thinking about the next three years or so, EFG core benefits will continue to deliver good cost optimization for us in the near term and then CI with SOAR will drive longer-term benefits for us. So we still think there's plenty of opportunity to keep operating margins in a very healthy 13% to 14% range here over the longer term.\nMichael Binetti: Very encouraging. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks and afternoon, everyone. I guess maybe I could try to just squeeze in a follow-up on Target and then another question. Maybe if you could just talk about any sort of thoughts on what consumers are buying there relative to kind of expectations, that would be helpful. And then just a bigger question, the brand owners seem to be reporting, what I guess I would call, kind of stickier D2C sales on their own website relative certainly to pre-pandemic levels. It would obviously seem like given your growth, these are incremental consumers to the category. So I'm curious how you're thinking about dealing with the partners as a supplier but also the customers -- or I mean the suppliers -- your suppliers, I should say and then how they're dealing with their own customers and how kind of those two things interplay in your business over time? Do you think that's incremental? Do you think that's potentially something that you've got to watch for going forward? Because, obviously, as I said, it hasn't seemed to have an impact so far.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll start with your second question and then Kecia can give any more color on the Target part of that. But on DTC, it's -- that's not new, not new this year. That's been DTC. That's been building for a while and so we really look at that as something that we're obviously monitoring and watching but also see as a development in the competitive landscape that we can manage through. And in fact, DTC, most of -- many of the DTC brands have found the importance of physical retail and many of them have chosen to partner with Ulta Beauty. So start DTC and come into Ulta Beauty. Ulta Beauty brands, some larger brands kind of building a DTC brand presence which we know is happening. But we see -- our model has been very different. The guest experience, the combination of in-store and online, our loyalty program, the breadth of products across price points, the depth within brands and segments and categories, the salon services, everything that we offer. The competitive differentiation that we have really separates us from our other retailers and from DTC. And as I said, many DTC are partnering with us, whether they're long-time established brands or newer brands and so we're watching that landscape. But for us, it's like we think with any competitive evolution in the category, we play offense. We do what we do best. We adjust and adapt but we look to drive our business forward in a really differentiated way and I think that's what's been driving our business so far this year. Kecia, any more color you want to add on the Target?\nKecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. What we're seeing is that they're shopping the entire assortment. You have to remember, this was a highly curated assortment of pure SKUs, best-selling items, must-have minis. So we are really pleased that they are shopping the entire shop-in-shop which is what the intention was. Was it not just to help them shop one category to get a taste of what Ulta Beauty has to offer as a whole in the shop. So I'd say bottom line, they're really shopping the entire assortment. We like what we're seeing so far.\nMark Astrachan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.\nOmar Saad: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. Appreciate all the color and especially the kind of initial look at what you think comps and sales could look like in 2022. I really want to kind of get a better understanding of what underlies that confidence behind what you think is a plus 3% to 5% kind of long-term algorithm on top of what's obviously going to be a very big number this year. I think investors expect some of these franchise. They've done so well this year to give back some of those gains next year. But obviously, you guys don't see it that way. Would love to know if it's -- whether it's reactivating existing customers or new customers coming in or the trends around product innovation. Would love to get a better sense of why you expect to grow on top of this great growth next year.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Omar, thanks for the question. Yes, I'd really -- I guess I'd answer that by looking back at what we shared at Analyst Day and the comprehensive nature of our strategic approach. There isn't any one thing that gives us confidence. And yes, we are having a very strong year, recovering out of the challenges of 2020 and increasing versus 2019. But by no means do we think this is kind of the end of the road. We actually see this is us strengthening and leading the category recovery. We think the category itself is going to be healthy beauty category in 2022 and beyond. And we think our differentiated model will continue to lead that category, gain share and drive growth for us. So it is the combination of an exceptional differentiated assortment. Nobody has the collection of products that we have and we've brought a lot of newness in this year, some of that hitting even late in the year like OLAPLEX hitting in January that we'll be driving. And we've got a pipeline that I'm excited about going into 2022 and we'll be sharing that as time is appropriate. So assortment always drives our business. Our loyalty program recovered from 2020, frankly, faster than we thought. And we think that's a great sign that what we believe what's going on in 2020 when we took a step back was not because they didn't like Ulta, just the disruption in their lives and they've shown us that retention is high. We're acquiring new members. We're bringing lapsed members back in and we see many more beauty enthusiasts to capture -- we see that growth happening across age groups. You know -- you've heard us talk about our strength with Gen Z as one example and we see a lot of opportunity to continue to gain with our loyalty program. And then frankly, the unique combination of digital and physical. We believe guests are showing us demonstrating with their loyalty and their spend that they really do prefer what all the data says and they're showing us with their dollars they prefer to shop a combination of physical and digital. That's why our e-com actually grew in Q3 after such strong growth in 2020, even as our stores show exceptional growth versus 2020. So that experience and our continued innovation and evolution across both digital and physical, we believe is where the consumer is going and we're leading in that as well. And then, all the other initiatives, our program with Target, of course, is massive, new programs like Ulta Beauty UB Media. So we think we've got a pipeline. Growth won't be what it is this year and that's reflected. But we're going to lead this category and it's going to take -- it will be a unique combination of what makes us differentiated that gives us confidence.\nOmar Saad: Thanks, Dave. Happy holidays.\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Omar.\nKiley Rawlins: We have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So Scott, I guess I just wanted for Q4, just dig into more how you're thinking about operating margins. So maybe if you can just talk more about the puts and takes on the gross margin and SG\u0026A line.\nScott Settersten: Sure. Thanks for the question. So big picture, operating margin versus 2020, it's going to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And versus 2019, we'd see some deleverage in operating margin. Again, both of those will have a mix of gross margin expansion and SG\u0026A deleverage. So gross margin goodness coming from all the things we've talked about this year, fixed store cost leverage, merchandise margin improvements versus 2020. Channel mix is a benefit for us versus last year. Channel mix, more of a headwind versus 2019. So gross margin leverage for both years. On the SG\u0026A line, again, deleverage for both years. 2020 not as significant as it is versus 2019. Again, 2020, consistent with all the things we've been talking about all year with the addition of incentive compensation, I guess I would say, is more significant in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year. And then when we compare it back to 2019, store labor and wages, not only hours but wage rates are up significantly versus 2019. Incentive comp, again, is a bigger impact versus 2019. If you remember, 2019, we were short of our targets in 2021. It's a bit of a different story and then marketing expense as well. Again, more investment versus 2019 when we were kind of battening down the hatches, I guess I would say, in a tougher environment. And this year, we're taking advantage of tailwinds and investing in market awareness activities to, again, capture more market share over the long term. So that's what I would say a short story. Again, super excited and happy with the results so far this year through Q3 and very encouraged and excited about the kickoff to the fourth quarter.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you. Happy holidays.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Dave Kimbell for closing remarks.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Well, thank you for joining us today and I want to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates across our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices who are working hard to ensure we deliver an outstanding guest experience this holiday season and who are committed to taking good care of our guests and each other every single day. As I said in the past, we have the absolute best team in retail and I am so proud to lead this great team. We hope you all have a safe and joyous holiday season and we look forward to speaking to all of you again in March when we report our fourth quarter and full year results. Have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.
ETSY~2021~4~168~1729~2/24/2022~.21352769~~~~-5.5566735~-3.3965504~-3.0944073~-3.1666305~1~Deb Wasser: Hi, everyone, and welcome to Etsy’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

With that, I will turn it over to Josh.\nJosh Silverman: Thanks, Deb, and good evening, everyone. Etsy delivered a strong fourth quarter to wrap up an impressive 2021 with record levels of GMS, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. During the holiday season, when many retailers were struggling with congested supply chains, Etsy sellers brought the benefits of shopping small to scale. And in doing so, we further cemented our place in buyers’ hearts while deepening our relationship with our sellers as well. Etsy’s mission is to keep commerce human, and we believe that these past 2 years have shown that the needs we meet are both powerful and enduring. 2021 was another historic record-breaking year for Etsy. And while the pandemic introduced millions of people to Etsy for the first time, shoppers have loved the experience they’ve had with Etsy and are coming back for more, even in a world of greatly expanded choice. We’re incredibly proud of our full year performance, which you can see on Slide 3, with consolidated GMS of $13.5 billion, up 29.6% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. GMS for the Etsy standalone marketplace grew 29% year-over-year and 158% on a 2-year basis. Consolidated revenue grew 35% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was a very strong 31% despite the anticipated dampening impact on our profitability from our 2 new subsidiaries. Rachel will review fourth quarter details later on. While 2021 was not the return to normalcy that many of us had hoped for, it did indeed offer greatly expanded options for consumers’ time and money compared with 2020, and many more places, online and off, where you could shop. Yet, Etsy continued to gain market share. In 2019, we laid out a long-term goal to outgrow e-commerce. And you can see that we have done that very substantially. And evidence is mounting through our cohort and brand data that these gains were not transitory. We believe that Etsy offers the world a true alternative to commoditize shopping, that buyers and sellers value this alternative, and we are in the early days of expanding our share of wallet. We grew that market share by bringing new buyers to the Etsy marketplace and encouraging our existing buyers to shop more frequently. A few things stand out when reviewing our 2021 performance on Slide 5. We continue to grow existing buyers, reaching a record high of 90 million active buyers. We reactivated nearly as many buyers in 2021 as we did in 2020, which is, in my view, simply remarkable. And while new buyer additions didn’t quite keep base with 2020’s spectacular level, new buyers still grew by 84% in 2021 when compared with the pre-pandemic level of 2019. And the pandemic cohort has been sticky. 53% of all active buyers who made a purchase on the Etsy marketplace in 2020 made another purchase in 2021, and 37% of new buyers in 2020 made a purchase in 2021. 2021 frequency metrics also improved, with 49% of active buyers making two or more purchases, up from 48% in 2020 and 41% in 2019. And GMS per active buyer on a trailing 12-month basis achieved a record $136 in the fourth quarter. We have always said that frequency is a challenging metric to move. So we are especially proud of the cross-functional efforts that drove these results. We believe there are several factors, inspiration, efficiency and reliability that will contribute to making Etsy the go-to e-commerce destination for many more consumers. Our investments in each of these areas have really been paying off. Our teams beat their purchase frequency goals for the year with creative approaches, including app downloads, post-purchase experience improvements, updates and offers. We also exceeded our goals for visit frequency with triggers like app icon badging and push notifications. This slide captures some of the many ways we are engaging with buyers along their Etsy journey to keep them revisiting and repurchasing, and you can expect to see much more of these work streams in 2022. Search and discovery made some big leaps forward in 2021, and we’ve only just begun to make the Etsy marketplace feel more made for you. Leveraging XWalk, we’re continuing to narrow the semantic gap by relying less on listing taxonomy and more on buyer interests. At year-end, our XWalk engine was utilizing over 4 billion data points, a 50% increase from when we launched in the second quarter of last year. This means we can use 16x more real-time data to capture semantic, meaning across our inventory with XWalk than we could with our prior search capabilities. Putting a finer point on it, Etsy search is simply getting better. On this slide, you can see some of the great progress we’ve made in U.S. search. For example, by year-end, about 95% of search purchases came from items appearing on the first page of search, up 10 percentage points from the beginning of last year. During the fourth quarter, we incorporated various additional data such as estimated delivery dates, real-time in-session features and listing information to improve organic search results. We also began laying the foundation to apply XWalk to non-U.S. search, clearly, a lot more to come in 2022. We continue to make Etsy even more human in many ways. For example, seller videos, which are a very visible example of how we drive human connection and engagement on and off the marketplace, topped 13 million by year’s end. Etsy’s dramatic growth has also necessitated that we invest and improve in many other often less visible ways to connect our 90 million buyers with over 5 million sellers. We’ve made meaningful improvements in our member support and trust and safety processes with a combination of people and technology to help make these experiences more joyful, safe and streamlined. For example, in member support, we’ve invested in self-service, better dashboards and education for our sellers so they can more quickly resolve issues without our intervention. And in trust and safety, investments have included expansion of our content moderation team, investing even more deeply in our handmade and counterfeit item efforts and creating a dedicated machine learning engineering team to support these initiatives. The size of these combined Etsy marketplace teams increased by about 35% last year, and our total 2021 investment was in excess of $100 million. We’re planning to significantly increase our investments in these areas in 2022 as well as we believe effectively managing complex, very human peer-to-peer interactions at scale is a big differentiator for Etsy. Reliability was a major focus area in 2021, and we made great strides. We improved delivery transparency and provided buyers with more clarity and certainty around their Etsy purchases. Just one example of a small iteration with big impact was the fourth quarter addition of estimated delivery date to our search and ranking models, perfect timing to help buyers narrow their searches for items that could arrive in time for the holidays. We also use new, highly sophisticated models, including many thousands of data points on ZIP codes and postal carrier performance, to anticipate holiday delays and dynamically adjust delivery dates. We had nearly 100% U.S. listing coverage for estimated delivery dates, tracking coverage and origin ZIP codes in time for the holiday crunch. In addition, 90% of U.S. domestic orders that were estimated to be delivered on time for the holidays did, in fact, arrive on time, up significantly from the 2020 holiday season. You’ll be hearing more about our efforts to further improve reliability in 2022, including work to achieve more consistent and transparent results in our core non-U.S. regions and deeper initiatives designed to ensure that shopping on Etsy feels worry-free. We believe reliability is the cornerstone of a habitual shopping experience, remaining a key needle mover to drive top-of-mind awareness, loyalty and frequency. Etsy marketplace sellers continue to thrive, growing in total number and the success of their shops. Turning to Slide 10, for the full year, active sellers grew by 28% and more than doubled on a 2-year basis. And even more importantly, our seller cohorts retain more GMS in subsequent years on the platform. We’re continuing to innovate in areas that matter to our global seller community such as improvements to the onboarding experience, particularly for international sellers, and investing in our seller app. And our Star Sellers represented 31% of fourth quarter GMS, with the program gaining traction with international sellers during the fourth quarter. Today, we announced an increase to our base transaction fee from 5% to 6.5% effective April 11. We expect to invest most of the incremental revenue into marketing, seller tools and creating world class customer experiences. Etsy enables anyone with a creative idea to start a business and reach a built-in audience of millions of shoppers. We’ve demonstrated our ability to drive more sales and value for our sellers and believe that this represents a fair exchange of value between Etsy and our seller community. We see so much opportunity to continue to raise top-of-mind awareness and consideration for Etsy, among those who already shop on Etsy and those who don’t. We have become a top 10 marketplace for buyers in several of our core international markets. We are reaching new audiences in the U.S. and we have made significant progress staying more top-of-mind in order to bring existing buyers back more frequently. Starting at the bottom of the funnel, we have improved our performance marketing feeds and Offsite Ads. In the middle of the funnel, we’ve had great engagement with our social content. For example, over 1 million people watch the sellers’ colorful weaving reel that’s shown on this slide. And at the top of the funnel, our brand campaigns cut through the noise. As you know, we’ve leaned more heavily into upper funnel brand marketing strategies since 2018 through TV, digital video and paid social to create a flywheel that elevates the effectiveness of all of our other marketing channels. These efforts have significantly moved the needle on brand awareness and loyalty. Our U.S. Etsy buyer surveys indicate that since the fourth quarter of 2018, we have nearly doubled buyers’ loyalty. Prompted awareness is up 11 percentage points, and unprompted awareness is up 8 percentage points. When we first showed you this data, we said our goal was to move the needle on purchase intent so that we could build top-of-mind awareness and consideration in the minds of buyers. And we’ve done just that. Purchase intent has come a very long way, up over 100%. And visit intent has nearly doubled in that same period. We believe this data further supports my earlier comment that the pandemic will have a lasting impact on our brand. We are seeing great movement in our brand funnel metrics in the other core markets where we’re investing in top-of-funnel marketing. In the United Kingdom, unprompted awareness was up 10 percentage points year-over-year. And in Germany, that same metric has more than doubled. The vast majority of our brand spend is currently in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. So you can imagine that we may decide in the future to take this strategy to other regions as well. In 2021, we also began focusing more on consumers who identify as male based on 2020 data that showed nearly 50% of male consumers in the U.S. were unaware of Etsy. We launched our first ever above-the-line campaign with specific media placements to reach broad male audiences and found these to be highly effective in building awareness and connection with the brand. We have also started to see some good efficacy from new channels like out-of-home, podcasting and highly targeted segmentation with our CRM tools. We see these all as important levers to further expand our buyer base in 2022 and beyond. 2021 was also a transformative year as we deepened our Right to Win strategy by identifying and integrating two great marketplaces that in many ways look like Etsy, creating a house of brands. As we look ahead, our North Star is to accelerate value creation for each subsidiary with the goal that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. You will see on this slide some examples of fourth quarter 2021 product and marketing initiatives at Reverb, Depop and Elo7, which are indicative of how they are utilizing the Etsy playbook that has unlocked so much value over the past 5 years. I am also incredibly proud of how we cared for our people, our communities and our planet in 2021. We come to work grateful to be able to support creative entrepreneurs around the world. In this new reality, it’s even more important that we take care of our team with empathy, resources and support to help them stay happy and productive. We continued to attract and retain world class talent in 2021 with a keen focus on diversity. In our soon-to-be-filed 10-K, you will see some strong movement in the percentage of our leadership level employee population who identify as a member of an underrepresented community. I am also proud that Etsy’s attrition remains significantly below industry averages, a testament, I believe, to the power of our mission, the health of our culture and the care we take of our team. In addition, we created impactful initiatives to support sellers from underrepresented communities, such as our work with the Gullah basket weavers. We drove our climate work forward by setting ambitious 2030 net zero targets and launching sustainable packaging for Etsy marketplace sellers. We collected over 6.8 million donations in 2021 for the uplift fund, our Donate the Change effort that supports the dismantling of barriers to creative entrepreneurship. And we engaged buyers in the positive impact that they create by launching an impact tracker that delivers a personalized digestive year activities such as the number of supported shops, environmental impact and uplift fund contributions. People want to shop their values. We know there’s so much more we can and should do to connect our mission to the impact our marketplace makes in the world, and we see this as an integral driver of growth for Etsy. One of my favorite investor questions is when someone asks what my big hairy audacious goal is for Etsy. Well, it’s to make Etsy the starting point for your e-commerce journey. We understand that’s quite a bold goal given that to make that ambition a reality, we must and are competing against the biggest names in e-commerce and all of retail for that matter. But we believe we have a real opportunity to win. We believe that unlike most of the rest, we offer something truly different and compelling. We aren’t trying to sell you the exact same commoditized product just $0.02 cheaper or 2 minutes faster. And that’s why for the Etsy marketplace alone, we see a TAM of about $2 trillion. We believe there are many more millions of potential buyers around the world who should be shopping on Etsy and so much more opportunity to build the Etsy habit for those who already know and love us. To get there, we plan to inspire buyers with an Etsy that feels personal and made for them, like a friend who gets to know you better over time; make buying on Etsy worry-free; be the selling platform that drives seller and buyer loyalty; strengthen the foundation of our House of Brands to enable growth for each marketplace; scale our infrastructure and safeguards to efficiently and sustainably power our global growth and availability; and foster an equitable and productive environment for our people. In 2022, you will see us doubling down on increasing buyer frequency through product and marketing experiences designed to inspire and reengage with better personalization, habit formation, intelligent retargeting and strategic discounting. And we’ll be leaning into messaging that reaffirms our belief that Etsy turns shopping into a joyful expression of your taste and your values. We believe it’s possible to achieve our bold ambition based upon the highly differentiated nature of our marketplaces, the clarity of our strategy and the talent of our team. Our Right to Win strategy is more relevant than ever, both for Etsy.com and our subsidiary brands. And I’ve never been more excited about Etsy’s growth opportunities than I am today. With that, I’ll turn it over to Rachel.\nRachel Glaser: Thanks, Josh and thank you everyone for joining us for our Q4 earnings call. My commentary today will cover consolidated results, key drivers of performance and Etsy marketplace results where appropriate. We achieved record levels of GMS, revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, all firmly ahead of our guidance. You can see on Slide 17 that on a consolidated basis, Etsy’s fourth quarter GMS grew 17% to $4.2 billion, revenue grew 16% to $717 million, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of nearly $219 million. Our fourth quarter caps off a strong year where consolidated GMS grew about 31%, revenue grew 35%, and adjusted EBITDA was $717 million with approximately a 31% margin. The additions of Depop and Elo7 contributed incremental GMS growth of approximately 5% for the quarter. It created about a 2% contraction to adjusted EBITDA margin. Reverb reported $948 million in 2021 GMS, up about 16% from 2020. And Depop and Elo7’s partial year GMS were $294 million and $32 million, respectively. The primary driver of our excellent fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA performance was sustained momentum in the Etsy marketplace’s top line growth, contributing significant flow-through to profitability. Consolidated take rate was 17.1%, a solid performance in a quarter where historically take rates contract to seasonality. As we have said on prior calls, our three subsidiaries generally have lower take rates in the Etsy marketplace, which had a take rate of about 18% in the quarter. Etsy marketplace Q4 GMS grew 11.8% year-over-year and 154% on a 2-year basis to $3.8 billion, also ahead of our guidance for high single-digit growth. And non-mask GMS grew 15% year-over-year. 3.2 million masks, were sold on Etsy in the fourth quarter, contributing $38.7 million of GMS, representing a 70% year-over-year decline in mask GMS to just 1% of total. It is worth taking a moment to appreciate the year-over-year top line growth in every quarter of 2021. Overall, the fourth quarter was quite dynamic given many of the factors we discussed on our last earnings call and those that evolved throughout the quarter, including the Omicron variant, supply chain disruptions, inflationary concerns and other factors impacting consumer behavior and spending patterns. Our record fourth quarter GMS performance was driven by an early and strong kickoff to the holiday season in October and extended strength through December. Our teams did a wonderful job, making Etsy a key holiday shopping destination with gift finders, exclusive sales and targeted efforts to engage new and existing buyers. Apparel was one of our fastest-growing categories, featuring best-selling items like family jammies. And the top two categories in the quarter were home and living and jewelry. We work hard to make sure that the marketplace is ready to serve the more than 5 million small businesses on Etsy to give them relevant streams, important time in retail and to ensure we can handle the high volume of activity. And that we did. Exciting marketplace stats included an 8% year-over-year increase in GMS per buyer on Black Friday, a record 2,000 orders per minute on Cyber Monday, nearly 0.5 million seller shops participating in our Cyber sales, up 27% from last year, and approximately $43,000 in GMS per minute during Cyber Five. From a geographic perspective, 44% of fourth quarter Etsy marketplace GMS was from transactions where either the buyer or the seller or both were outside the U.S., as you can see on Slide 20. Non-U.S. GMS was up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and was driven in part by strong trends in the UK and Germany. In fact, domestic sales represented over 70% of both the United Kingdom and Germany’s GMS last year, proof points of our success creating vibrant domestic markets in our core geographies. Non-U.S. active buyers reached an all-time high of 31 million in the fourth quarter, continuing to outpace the growth in U.S. active buyers. Consolidated fourth quarter revenue was driven by growth in both marketplace and services revenue, up 14% and 22% year-over-year, respectively. You can see a walk of our incremental revenue from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of incremental revenue within marketplace can be attributed to GMS flow-through, within services, a key driver with strong Etsy Ads growth of approximately 28% year-over-year. Our two new subsidiaries were also sources of incremental revenue. As we’ve been highlighting, we see investments in product and marketing as critical components to drive future growth. One way to visualize this is shown on Slide 22. We start the year with baseline GMS stemming from prior cohorts coming back over time and which includes the benefit from the prior year’s product and marketing investments. We then layer on top of that new investments in product and marketing that we expect to drive conversion rate and frequency. And together, they form the forecast for our in-year GMS. This becomes the baseline for next year, a virtuous flywheel that helps drive future growth. Specifically related to our 2021 product investments, you can see here how we have scaled our spend as a percentage of revenue. Some of the most impactful product wins in 2021 were those that drove frequency, improved seller tools such as thank you coupons, app downloads and our investments in search. In fact, product investments generated over $1 billion in annualized GMS return in 2021. As outlined on the prior slide, we get a partial benefit from this impact in-year, and it’s the gift that keeps on giving, with future payback expected in 2022 and beyond as the marketplace improvements we make help drive buyer stickiness and frequency. We ended the year with 2,402 employees, an increase of 70% compared to last year. While a significant amount of this increase was the result of our two acquisitions, Etsy’s standalone headcount grew 31%, with many of those hires in product development and engineering. Fourth quarter consolidated direct marketing expense was $172 million, down 12% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we had run incrementality tests that surfaced opportunities to optimize our performance marketing spend. This model refinement enabled us to lower spending for product listing ads, SEM and social on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, which helped to drive up our margin. We offset approximately 40% of performance marketing spend for Etsy.com through off-site Ads revenue, which enables us to put more dollars to work on behalf of our sellers in a profitable way. All in all, our performance marketing spend drove approximately $2.3 billion in annualized GMS in 2021. Consolidated brand marketing spend, which include television and digital video, was 25% of our consolidated marketing spend in the fourth quarter, representing approximately $50 million of spend. For the full year, we increased brand marketing spend by 30%, specifically leaning more heavily into TV and digital video in the United Kingdom and Germany. We’re confident that the incremental marketing spend in Germany, particularly our Etsy HotSeat campaign, meaningfully impacted our brand awareness metrics. Moving to our Etsy marketplace operating metrics, we have seen excellent stability in our active buyer count with 90 million at year-end, up 9 million total for 2021. And buyers are spending more with Etsy, with our GMS per active buyer reaching an all-time high of $136 in the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year. We believe this metric is a useful way to track the success of our efforts to drive buyer retention, frequency and purchases. Repeat Etsy buyers represent shoppers who made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months. You can see on Slide 26 that we ended 2021 with 36 million repeat buyers with a 2-year growth rate of 121%. We separate out our repeat buyers from our habitual wires, those that shop on Etsy six or more times per year and spend at least $200. In my view, one of our most exciting data points is the growth in habitual buyers. We ended the year with 8.1 million habitual buyers, a record level, up 26% year-over-year and up 224% on a 2-year basis. These buyers comprise about 9% of our total active buyers, up from about 5% in 2019, yet accounted for 45% of 2021 GMS. And we are acquiring millions of new buyers. New buyer acquisition grew 44% sequentially in the quarter to 10 million, the highest quarterly level reported all year. As we’ve been highlighting throughout 2020 and 2021, there has also been a massive reawakening of lapsed buyers over the past 2 years. In fact, we reactivated 6.8 million buyers in the fourth quarter, up 65% sequentially versus the third quarter and edging past the year ago quarter. In total, 21.4 million buyers were reactivated in 2021, nearly as many as in 2020. We continue to see buyer reactivation as a key to our long-term growth as buyers often lacks in their Etsy purchases and believe we still have significant room to reengage buyers and build top-of-mind awareness and consideration. Moving to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. You can see on the right how our capital-light business model has delivered record levels of quarterly operating cash flow even when compared with the prior year’s very strong performance. Moving to our outlook. In the first quarter of 2021, Etsy reported 132% GMS growth, which we believe is among the highest growth rates ever reported by a U.S. public e-commerce company. Q1 of last year was a particular anomaly, with 8 percentage points of growth coming from the tailwind of seamless checks, coupled with deep pandemic lockdowns, which we estimate contributed a tailwind similar to the stimulus. As we’ve said all year, the comparisons of the first quarter 2022 to the first quarter of 2021 will be difficult. Now that we are in late February of the new year, it does feel like there is a possibility of a new normal. We’re watching the same economic and consumer data that you are, and we can see that travel, eating out and other measures of mobility are on the rise. People are tired of staying home. We are, too. And so it’s not surprising to see the long-awaited reopening headwinds impact our February results. Following a very strong January, we began to experience reopening headwinds with a notable deceleration in February. So to date, February was still positive on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, given the March 2021 round of stimulus checks, March will be another tough comp. Despite last year’s huge spike in Q1 and the reopening softness we’ve seen this month, our guidance implies that Etsy standalone will keep all of the significant gains of last year in spite of the tailwinds from stimulus checks and walk downs turning to headwinds. And that is before the benefit of our new subsidiaries. We think this is quite remarkable and a very encouraging indication of the durability of the growth we’ve experienced over the last 2 years. We currently expect first quarter consolidated GMS to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect that our first quarter revenue will be $565 million to $590 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin will be about 26%. While macro conditions remain extremely uncertain, and we are not providing annual guidance, we did want to outline some factors to consider for your full year models. Both the 2020 and the 2021 Etsy standalone quarterly GMS cadence were impacted by pandemic headwinds and tailwinds, anomalies when compared with our historical GMS seasonality. This makes the quarterly GMS cadence in our last pre pandemic years, 2018 and 2019, a more normalized template to use for your modeling for 2022. Traditionally, Etsy has a seasonally lower first quarter, with sequential growth in Q2 and Q3 relative to Q1 building to a strong Q4. In fact, Q4 is typically about 30% to 32% of annual GMS. As GMS from our subsidiaries is expected to be less than 15% of our total GMS in 2022, this quarterly cadence supports consolidated GMS as well. We currently expect lower GMS growth year-over-year in the first half of ‘22 and higher GMS growth in the second half as our comps begin to normalize, assuming relatively stable macroeconomic conditions. And while the impact of the transaction fee increase is forecasted to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA dollars, we expect the fee change to be roughly neutral to margins given our planned reinvestments in growth driving initiatives. Keep in mind that the higher take rate is also expected to drive our LTV higher so we can invest in more ways that benefit our sellers. It’s important to remember that our newly acquired subsidiary brands, Depop and Elo7, are completely additive to our first half growth, but we will lap those acquisitions in July. Our three subsidiaries together represent about 400 basis points in reduction in consolidated EBITDA margin, though Reverb is EBITDA positive. The size of our addressable market is enormous, and we see a clear and compelling road map for continued growth with investments in people and technology across our House of Brands. While reopening and macro conditions inject some near-term uncertainty and headwind into the forecast, we have conviction about the opportunities for growth, and we will continue to invest with discipline and focus in ways we believe deliver strong long-term results for our stakeholders. Before opening up for your questions, I’ll turn it back to Josh for some closing remarks.\nJosh Silverman: While we’re facing reopening headwinds we’ve long anticipated, we see these as short-term with significant tailwinds at our back. In a world that we believe has been forever transformed by the massive adoption of e-commerce, Etsy, too, has been transformed. Marketplaces get better as they get bigger, and we’re now more than 2.5x bigger than we were before the pandemic. We have many millions more buyers who love us and are coming back for more, tens of millions more unique listings from which they can shop. And our core Etsy brand is becoming a household name. And we have a capital-light business model that serves as a flywheel for long-term profitable investment. While wallet share may shift for a bit to out-of-home endeavors, people still need to buy things. And we believe Etsy is simply a better way to shop. It’s still early days for e-commerce, and it remains our goal to continue to outgrow the broader e-commerce industry on average and over time. It’s a massive opportunity, and we feel extremely well positioned to grab a bigger share. Thank you all for your time today. I’ll now turn the call over to Deb.\nDeb Wasser: Thanks, everyone. Before we dive into questions, Josh wants to make one quick opening remark.\nJosh Silverman: Thanks, Deb. Those were prerecorded remarks we recorded a couple of days ago. And so I just need to start by acknowledging the events that are happening in the Ukraine today. The invasion of the Ukraine obviously weighs heavily on all of us. So we’re reporting our results as usual, but today is certainly anything but a usual day and wanted to acknowledge our hearts go out to our buyers and sellers and community in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as well as our global community that’s impacted by these events. Thank you.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Alright. Great. Thanks, Josh.\nA - Deb Wasser: Okay. We will start with the question from Maria Ripps at Canaccord. I’ll start with Josh on this one. Increasing order frequency has been one of your top priorities, and it seems like you’ve been particularly successful driving that metric up for your newer cohorts. Can you just talk about whether that’s a reflection of all the improvements on the platform such as search, personalization, delivery transparency, etcetera or is it the type of buyers that you’re acquiring more recently? How – and how has some of this been leveraged across the buyer base – your wire buyer base, so frequency and products? Yes.\nJosh Silverman: Great question. I don’t think it’s due to acquiring a different kind of buyer. We’re really seeing a broad-based lift across our existing buyers as well as our new cohorts. So, habitual buyers continue to be the fastest-growing segment. Habitual buyers doubled in 2021 and then grew by 26% again – doubled in 2020 and grew by another 26% in 2021. To put another point on it, about half of our buyers now are repeat, meaning they buy more than once in a year. And for those repeat buyers, they are actually buying an average of 5x a year. Habitual buyers are about 9% of our buyers but represent about 45% of our GMS, and those buyers are buying more than once a month. And so when we look at the opportunity, I know in my household, something arrives from Etsy every week. And it’s not that I think we shop a lot more than others, but we primarily shop online. And when we shop online, Etsy is our starting point. We know that there is great products available on Etsy. And we start there and we go elsewhere only if we can’t find something on Etsy. So we see a ton of opportunity. And the growth in habituals, we think, is a great proof point for the opportunity for everyone to be shopping a lot more on Etsy. To the question of how, I’d start with having a great buyer experience. You can have all the tactics in the world you want. But the main thing is when you come to Etsy, did you find something you love? And when it arrived in the mail, did you actually love the product? Was it what you thought? And again and again, buyers are finding something they love on Etsy. And when it arrives in the mail, they are delighted by the actual purchase. And that is the foundation of our success and will continue to be. We talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about some of the tactics that have been particularly successful, but I would start by saying triggering people off-line to remind them that there is something available on Etsy. Having more of them come to the app, as an example, where we have a particularly great experience and where we see more habitual usage, having search work harder to recommend the right things for them as well as to get them to the best item quickly, and then reinforcing reliability. We talked a little bit in this call about having estimated delivery dates and then meeting those expectations. And it’s so important for us to be a habit that people know that they can rely on us. And we can tell them when they can expect the item to arrive, and it will arrive on time as we said. So we’re really proud of the progress we’ve made there, and we think all of those are key to why we’ve seen real success in frequency.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Thank you. So Rachel, I’m going to take this one for you. We’ve gotten the same question from multiple people, Naved Khan from Truist; John Colantuoni from Jefferies; and others. What does the outlook assume for core Etsy GMS growth? And then the second part of that question is, can you help us further disaggregate how much of the slowdown is the result of an unusually difficult comparison in the year a quarter ago created by some transitory one-time events like tailwinds, like stimulus? And how much is really the ongoing impact of consumers adjusting their behavior as the world reopen? So I’ll let Rachel start, and then I’m sure Josh will probably want to pile on as well.\nRachel Glaser: Thank you for the question and hello everyone. So let’s take it apart, what did we say about the quarter? The guidance we gave implies about approximately 5% for consolidated Etsy at the midpoint. And we have said that our subsidiaries are less than 15% of our total GMS. And so what we said was, depending on where in the range you pick that Etsy is at least keeping all of the gains that it had from last year. So you would say roughly flat at the midpoint. But it’s important to – we took some time to take you through what last year was like. So Q1 last year was 132% growth. We did some research to see if anyone has reported any number that high. And amongst many, many companies, we were way at the tippy top of the highest growth rate that we could find. And it’s also important to remember what we said last year was that stimulus checks added about 8 full percentage points of growth to that first quarter. And we think the sort of deep pandemic lockdowns that we had last year at the same time, added at least that much also in terms of growth. So if you were to take that flat and add that 16 points of growth, that’s where we think we would organically be panning out at least around now. We also gave some color on what’s happening during the quarter. So we said we had a strong January. And then we started to notice a sharp decel in February, which would be timed approximately with when stimulus checks started to be coming and being distributed last year at this time. And we think March has an even stronger comp to beat. So I am not clearly disaggregating it for you, but there is a blend of help tailwind that is no longer here now and the fact that we are seeing reopening happen and that people – there is this pent-up demand to go out, to dine out, to travel. We’re looking at the mobility indices, and we’re seeing that, that indeed is increasing at the inverse rate to e-commerce declining. And – but we’re very, very pleased that we’re hanging on to all the gains that we had from a year ago.\nDeb Wasser: Josh, do you want to add anything on that?\nJosh Silverman: Nothing to add.\nDeb Wasser: Okay, awesome. From Kunal Madhukar from UBS. This one is for Josh. Can you talk about the TAM, especially in terms of how much of your market opportunity is handmade?\nJosh Silverman: Yes. I mean if you go look at the latest Q, we put a lot of data in there. We estimate it to be about $2 trillion. And if the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that the distinction between online and off-line is arbitrary. And what do I mean by that? When you talk to buyers on their shopping mission, they don’t say, I’m looking for the best online place to buy this or I’m looking for the best off-line place to buy that. Most of them, they are looking for a gift for their mother or a throw pillow for their living room, and they are going to go to online and off-line places. And what we’re seeing is Etsy can compete effectively against both online and off-line. That’s really one market in the minds of buyers. When we look at the categories in which Etsy participates, we sell a great many things. We don’t sell consumer electronics. We don’t sell groceries, to name two big ones. We don’t sell travel, but we sell most other things that consumers buy. And we really have seen that over the past 2 years. When home and living spiked, we were there for you. When gardening spiked, we were there for you. When pet supplies spiked, we were there for you. When gifts spiked, we were there for you. Who knew that the bread-making products were available on Etsy? I didn’t, shame on me, until bread-making became a big thing. And all of a sudden, we see it. So, the variety – the versatility of the Etsy marketplace is quite remarkable. And then our global opportunity, we have been investing in some key core markets, but we think most markets make sense for Etsy. And if you look at the absolute explosion in demand on the buyer and the seller side in the UK, it’s a great testament to – we’ve been planting seeds in the UK for many years. And holy cow, did they grow. Great, big forest almost overnight and we think that kind of opportunity exists in many, many countries all around the world. So when you add it up, it’s a $2 trillion TAM. An analogy I might paint is in a very different category. But if you look at – at Airbnb, for example, they talk about the hospitality industry writ large as their TAM. And if I’m on a business trip in Chicago, and I’m going to – I need a bed for 7 hours, I’m going to fly in and fly out, I might go to a Marriott or a Hilton. I don’t really care. I just want it to be kind of cheap and commodity. If I’m taking my family and I want a special experience, Airbnb is a great opportunity. And so they are looking for the special of hospitality. We’re the special of e-commerce. And I think that opportunity is massive. And obviously, retail at writ large is a very, very big TAM to be playing in.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Great. Thanks, Josh. This one is from Lauren Schenk from Morgan Stanley, and I’ll start with Rachel on this one. Is there any additional color you can share on how you’re thinking about full year EBITDA margin given all of the moving pieces such as our M\u0026A, our fee increase and incremental investments?\nRachel Glaser: Lauren, thank you for the question. We’ve said so many times that we love our marketplace model, and I think our profits are one of the differentiating things that make Etsy special, too. So it’s a great question, and I love to talk about it. Why do we love our marketplace model so much? First of all, we have said that our cost base is highly variable. We don’t have distribution centers. We don’t have retail stores. We don’t even have very much capital investment. And so because it’s variable, we are able to pull those levers as we want, leaning into marketing and hiring of people and investing in product development. When we can, like you saw us do in March of 2020, when we first saw the pandemic starting where a lot of companies decided to pull back on those things, we leaned into it, and it was to our benefit. So I’ll start with that fact, putting that out there that we have a highly cash-generative model with a very high flow-through of top line to our bottom line. Secondly, we did announce a transaction fee increase. And like we did on another transaction fee increase that we did in 2018, we plan to reinvest a considerable portion of that incremental revenue back into the marketplace because we want to directly have that benefit the seller. So a lot of that will go into marketing and customer support and product development like we did before. The lever we can pull the fastest is in marketing. And that allows us to be able to spend more and still achieve the ROI threshold that we set for ourselves. So we plan to invest that at about the rate of our current EBITDA margins, which means EBITDA dollars are going to grow. But with more top line, we might see EBITDA margins stay about the same as where they are now. I want to talk about the take rate for a minute to make sure that people get that right in their model. So, I am going to put a pin in the take rate question. I also want to talk about our subsidiaries. They do contract our EBITDA margins I think we said by about 300 basis points. It’s another thing to think about when you think about EBITDA for the full year. Further, we have lots of room to scale. Our revenue per headcount is considerably higher than peer benchmark. So, you can go check that in your research, but we have checked it. And that means we have a lot of room to invest not only in things that drive top line growth, but in our infrastructure, things that keep our marketplace safe that help ensure our trusted brand and help our developers do what they do in a much more agile way. So, we are continuing to invest in those things. So, real quick on take rate, when you think about take rate for 2021, the full year take rate was an effective 17.3% approximately. But before you add directly the take rate impact to – the 1.5% take rate impact to that, you have to think about what that 17.3% was on a pro forma basis because we didn’t have the subs in for that whole year. And so the pro forma number is more like 17%. So, you would add that 1.5%, but only to Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2022, because that’s when the new transaction fee comes into effect. And that gets you to something around 18.5% when you add those things in for – on a full year basis for our take rate. So, those are the comments I will make about full year EBITDA. Maybe Josh has something to add.\nJosh Silverman: No. I think we mean this is 18.5% for Q2, three and four, right?\nRachel Glaser: Yes, for those quarters. I am sorry if I...\nJosh Silverman: That was great.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Perfect. Alright. Next one, I will start with Josh on this one, from Victoria James at D.A. Davidson. How, if at all, have you been impacted by consumers returning to physical stores as suggested by some of your e-commerce peers such as Wayfair?\nJosh Silverman: Well, just to pick home and living for just a second, because it is an interesting one. We have said that, that has been our largest category. We saw an explosion in home and living during the pandemic. We saw an explosion in almost everything during the pandemic, but home and living more than even most, and it is now our number one category. It’s a very large category for us. Home and living is running roughly flat right now, just barely above zero in terms of growth rate. And I think that’s kind of amazing given that, again, this time last year, there was stimulus and there was lockdowns and you had no other – few other places – obviously, there were some, but a few other places to go to shop. So, the fact that we are growing over that and still keeping that spend, I think is kind of remarkable. Also true that there has been a lot of nesting that’s gone on for the past 2 years. And it’s fair to assume that people might have spruced up their current place about as much as they want to spruce it up. And when interest rates rise, people may move homes less, and that tends to be a headwind to home furnishings. And so I won’t be surprised to see home furnishings as a category face headwinds as we move through this year, and it is our largest category. But what we hear from buyers is they love Etsy, and they love the experience they have had on Etsy. And it feels different, and it feels compelling to them. So, the threat of offline, we are prepared to compete with offline. We are compared to compete with come who may. We do see that, first, our – we think that the category mix on Etsy is a real strength of ours. So for example, home furnishings right now is roughly flat. Weddings is growing in the mid-20s, mid-20%. And it’s a great example of we sell lots of things and lots of categories. And some of them are going to be headwinds, and some of them are going to be tailwinds. Now weddings is a much smaller category than home furnishings at the moment. But over time, that can change. What we are hearing from consumers, though, is general concern with their spending overall. Inflation is a concern with them. They don’t – aren’t getting stimulus checks now. By the way, people have to repay their student loans. There is $1 trillion of student loan debt out there that people haven’t had to pay for a while. There has been a lot of rent forgiveness that’s probably ending. So, there is a lot more demands for their wallet. And oh, yes by the way, they want to travel, and they want to dine out. And as Rachel said, why, so do all of us. So, we won’t be surprised to see more competition for consumer wallets generally where discretionary spend in retail and e-tail is going to have to fight a little harder against some other categories. But we are certainly compared to fight for the share of dollars that are going to discretionary retail and e-tail. We are ready, willing and able to fight for our share of that.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Great. This one is from Anna Andreeva, Needham. Marketing continues to be reined in for the past two quarters, if that’s not affecting demand. With GMS beating plan again in Q4 of ‘21, what drove the decision to pull back during Q4? And how do you think about marketing in Q1 and for the full year? I am not sure which one of you want to take that one.\nRachel Glaser: I think Josh was going to start, so I am going to follow-up.\nDeb Wasser: Josh, you go.\nJosh Silverman: Great. Thanks for the question. We have said through the years that we are very disciplined at looking at the marginal return on the next dollar spend in marketing. And we do that with performance marketing. We do that above the line. And we are constantly testing in each channel PLA, social and whatnot. When we spend a little deeper, what do we get for it, and when we pull back, what do we get for it. It’s also worth noting that, that changes over time. Consumer behavior is changing. The competitive landscape is changing. The market rates for CPMs and whatnot are changing. And so we are constantly testing that. And when we find that the marginal return on the next dollar has maybe evolved and isn’t as good as we thought, we can pull back and be more efficient. And we are always looking to be as efficient as we can with spend. What we saw in the fourth quarter is we had a lot of tailwinds. Things were going very well. And the marginal returns on some of our spend, therefore, we are not as high, meaning the incrementality was lower. If we hadn’t spent that dollar, we still would have gotten the sale. So, we pull back. And that’s adjustment that we are always doing. It’s also worth noting that when we raise our take rate, as we announced today, the lifetime value of each interaction, each buyer we bring in or the repeat purchase goes up. And that allows us to spend deeper. And we think that’s a great thing for our seller community and for our marketplace as a whole.\nDeb Wasser: Great. Okay. This one is from Seth Sigman at Guggenheim. Habitual buyers increased 9% of buyers from 8% in 2020 and to 45% of GMV, up from 40% in the prior year. So, not only is Etsy converting more habitual buyers, but these habitual buyers are also spending more. What are the learnings from these buyers that are applicable to the broader buyer base? That’s a great question for you, Josh.\nJosh Silverman: I think the big lesson is that we have an opportunity to be a starting point for commerce. I think that this period of time has caused all of us to be aware of the role we play in this global supply chain where things are mass produced at huge quantity far away to go on a boat, to go on a train, to go on a truck, to end up at your household, to have you look and be just the same as all of your neighbors and then end up in a landfill two seconds later. And I think we are seeing a rise of conscious consumerism where people really want to maybe buy fewer things, but have those things mean more, express themselves in their sense of style and taste, differentiate from others and maybe last longer and not end up in a landfill. And by the way, if you can buy it from the person who made it and have it be within your own state or within your own country and feel like you are supporting your local community, isn’t that nice. And does it even have to cost more, if you think about all the markups that happened from the time that product was mass produced until the time it ended up in your doorstep, there are four or five people that took markups along the way. So, when this maker makes it and sends it directly to you, maybe shopping small can actually give you great value as well as a sense of style. I think we are beginning to realize that there is a different way to shop that is often a better way to shop. And I am not saying for everything all the time. You are still going to need those commodities of life that you don’t care about at all. And you are going to use them, dispose of them, and that’s fine. But for a lot of purchases that we all make, there is a different way to show up. As I said, at least one package a week arrives from Etsy at my household just because we think to start at Etsy. As I said, our habitual shoppers are shopping at least once a month – on average, are shopping more than once a month on Etsy. And what’s different about them, I think it’s just that they have figured out that Etsy is a place where you can find many things. So, our opportunity is to help educate the rest of the market and to help train that Etsy can be a starting point for their e-commerce. And I think the opportunity there is absolutely enormous.\nDeb Wasser: Rachel, did you want to add…?\nRachel Glaser: I was going to give some data, and he gave it. There is great habitual – in fact, Seth, you had a lot of the data in your question. And then the once per month is actually more than double what we are seeing from our – the average for our repeat buyers. So, there is significant value to the habitual buyer segment.\nDeb Wasser: Perfect. Okay. I will move to one from Shweta Khajuria. Can you please provide details on Etsy’s initiatives this year, 2022, to drive purchase frequency? Can you give us some examples of what those might be focused on, buyer inspiration, efficiency or liability? Josh?\nJosh Silverman: Yes. So, on the inspiration level, you are starting to see us do more to present you with recommendations of things you hadn’t thought of or even things like continuous feeds of lean-back experiences where you can just see streams of all the really cool things on Etsy. So, for example, like video reels of things being made, which is really addictive and compelling. And we are making great progress in our recommendation engine to be able to inspire you with things that you are likely to like, but maybe hadn’t even thought to come to Etsy for. And that understanding things like taste and style would have been impossible years ago. But with advances in machine learning, we start to be able to intuit what your taste is and what of the 100 million things for sale on Etsy, other things that are – meet that sense of style. In terms of efficiency, obviously, the search engine getting better, and I shared some data on the dramatic gains we are making there, but getting you to the right item quickly. So, you feel like when you know what you want, you can get in and out quickly, that’s also very important. And reliability is critical. And I shared some data about how, over the holiday period, 90% of items arrived on time. Another data point we didn’t share, but I think is a great one, 98% of things that we said would arrive in time for the holidays arrived in time for the holidays. And that’s really critical that we do what we say and that you learn to be able to trust Etsy. And that can move us from being the occasional purchase where maybe you can afford for things to go wrong to being something that’s really your everyday tried and true. And we have made great strides there, and you will see us continue to invest meaningfully this year to make sure that buyers really know that we have their back and that they can buy on Etsy in a really worry-free way. And I don’t think it’s a silver bullet that all of a sudden changes things. But I think that over a period of months and years, as people really learn how reliable Etsy can be, I think it can dramatically change consumer behavior.\nDeb Wasser: Okay. Great. I know we went over, but I do want to get in a concept about our subsidiaries. So, we have gotten a couple of questions, one from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc and one from Laura Champine at Loop that are – regarding our subs. So, can we talk about the growth profiles for Depop, Reverb and Elo7? And then specifically, Laura asked about the marketing strategy for Depop in 2022. So Josh, you want to take those?\nJosh Silverman: Sure. So I would say that broadly speaking, Depop and Reverb are facing similar headwinds – reopening headwinds to Etsy. If we talk about Depop just for a second, the UK – and Depop has a lot of their business in the UK. Teenagers in the UK were literally locked in their apartments for 2 years. The lockdowns there were quite extreme. And they are now allowed to go out, and they are availing themselves of that, and I don’t blame them. I have got two teenagers in the home. I can relate. And so there are some reopening headwinds there that we have been expecting and aren’t surprised by and we think are going to be temporary. And then as teenagers get a chance to get outside again, they are going to want to refresh their wardrobes and get back on Depop in levels at and above where they have been. And Reverb similarly, there has been some reopening headwinds there, but all expected. Elo7 a little different, and that Elo7’s business is very event-based. And so their business is really centered around things like baby showers,  and things like that. And the vaccinations have been more broadly spreading through Brazil. We think that’s really encouraging. But people are not gathering together in numbers yet in Brazil. And so we think that, that is going to come – hopefully going to come real soon, and we will provide a real tailwind for Elo7. And so we will see what the coming months bring there. In terms of the marketing strategy, for Depop, we are leaning into above the line with Depop. We are testing that in the U.S. right now to really make their brand a little more front and center. We are also testing performance marketing for the first time with Depop. And so there will be some margin impact to that, but we think it’s great investment over time. We think it’s the right thing to do. We have a lot of faith and confidence in Depop and are excited to invest to grow that business and that platform.\nDeb Wasser: Okay, great. Thank you all for hanging with us. A little bit over time here. We really appreciate it, and we will be here to answer all of your questions. So, that ends the call for this evening. Thank you.\nRachel Glaser: Thank you everyone.
NFLX~2021~4~324~4293~1/20/2022~-.26120725~-.27000633~~~-3.9835842~-4.0923843~-4.1719236~-4.1510143~1~Spencer Wang : Hello. And welcome to the Netflix Q4 2021 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEO, Reed Hastings; Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; COO and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann.  Our interviewer this quarter is Nidhi Gupta from Fidelity. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.  Nidhi, over to you now to kick off the Q\u0026A.\nQ - Nidhi Gupta : Thank you, Spencer. Good to be with you all again. Great to see all the new content over the quarter. I've been a little less productive, so I think I can blame you all for that. As usual, I'd like to start with net adds during the quarter, which came in a little bit later than you expected. Just help us understand the underperformance there.\nTed Sarandos : Nidhi, 8.3 versus 8.5, a little less\nReed Hastings: 222 million.\nSpencer Neumann : In fairness, Nidhi said it was a little shy. So I'll take what Nidhi says. As she says, we delivered -- first, we're quite pleased with how the quarter played out. We delivered 8.3 million paid net adds. So it was just a bit shy about tenth of a percent on roughly 222 million paying members.  And overall, we're quite pleased with how our titles performed. We had big viewing. We started the quarter with Squid Game becoming a global phenomenon, and we ended the quarter in December with big TV series like the finale of La Casa de Papel, a big returning show in The Witcher, our two biggest movie releases of all time.  So overall, the business was healthy. Retention was strong. Churn was down. Viewing was up. But on the margin, we just -- we didn't grow acquisition quite as fast as we would have liked to see on our large subscriber base. A small change in acquisition can have a pretty big flow-through in paid net adds. And again, our acquisition was growing, just not growing quite as fast as we were perhaps hoping or forecasting.\nNidhi Gupta : Great. And as we look ahead to Q1, the guidance was a bit below kind of what was expected and what you've done in previous Q1s. Maybe just help us understand what some of the key considerations were that went into the guidance? And does it raise any concerns for you about anything structural, whether it's competition or saturation? Or does it give you any pause in terms of sort of your return on content spend?\nSpencer Neumann : Sure. No structural change in the business that we see. What's reflected in the guidance, we guided to 2.5 million paid net adds in Q1. And what's reflected there is pretty much the same trends we saw in Q4. So healthy retention with churn down. Healthy viewing and engagement, with viewing up.  And acquisition just growing but a bit slower than pre-COVID levels, just hasn't fully recovered. And we're trying to pinpoint what that is. It's tough to say exactly why our acquisition hasn't kind of recovered to pre-COVID levels. It's probably a bit of just overall COVID overhang that's still happening after two years of a global pandemic that we're still unfortunately not fully out of, some macroeconomic strain in some parts of the world, like Latin America, in particular.  While we can't pinpoint or point a straight line using when we look at the data on a competitive impact, there may be some kind of more on the marginal kind of side of our growth, some impact from competition. But which, again, we just don't see it specifically. So overall, that's what's reflected in the guide. I'd say we -- our big titles are also landing, at least our known big titles a little bit later in the quarter with Season 2 of Bridgerton in March, The Adam Project also in March. As you know, we also -- while we are taking -- changing prices in countries every quarter. In Q1 of this year, it happens to be our largest country, as we announced last week, actually our largest region with Canada as well. So that's probably a little bit more impact than a typical quarter.\nReed Hastings : But Nidhi, you're right to reflect on two years ago, we were 10 million above plan, which was a shock. Last year, we were 10 million below or 9 million. And so the pull forward sort of makes it hard to read. In the prior years, we are very steady, so we can have confidence on incremental trends.  But as Spence said, when we reflect of course, hey, that’s a little guide and we think it will be accurate. It’s not sand packed at all, kind of that's what's going on. And there's a number of potential explanations with COVID, but then we worry about having too much on that. There's more competition than there's ever been. But we have Hulu with Amazon for 14 years. So it doesn't feel like any qualitative change there. And overall, confidence in streaming becomes all of entertainment. Linear dissipates over the next 10 to 20 years, very high confidence in that thesis because everyone's coming into streaming. So like market size, very large. Our execution is steady and getting better. So for now, we're just like staying calm and trying to figure out, again, the COVID has introduced so much noise. It just wants us to give it some pause as we work on everything we've always worked on.\nTed Sarandos : And just to reiterate, I'd say we took a big bet years ago on this. The people would move on to Netflix and Netflix-type offerings to consume movies and film. That was a big, big bet that we've seen continue to go through.  We have no change in our confidence in that. And I think what's really been great about 2021, even through all those conditions, we were able to kind of prove out to other theses that we've bet on starting years ago one big one around our investment in international programming. We're glad that we started that 7 years ago with Club de Cuervos. And now we were betting that you could take films and series from anywhere in the world and entertain the entire world.  And we were getting more -- bigger and bigger milestones against that goal. And now we have proven to have kind of global sensations from France with Lupin, from Spain with La Casa de Papel and Elite . And then in the biggest way possible in 2021 was Squid Game, which has become our biggest series ever. And it is unapologetically and perfectly Korean. So it's not built to be this kind of global thing. It's proving that great storytelling from anywhere in the world can entertain the world. And our other big bet was our investment in big budget feature films. And our bet that we could effectively release them and compete with big theatrical releases for audience and for attention. And Red Notice this year, of course and Don't Look Up have become our number 1 and number 2 most watched movies ever on Netflix. And if you look at the hours that we publish out, you can do the math and back into it. They may be the most watched movies anywhere in the world this year.  So I think those 2 bets coming through. It kind of strengthens our confidence in the overall bet in the service, and pleasing customers and leaning into consumer first business models, I think we could succeed there.\nNidhi Gupta : Yeah. And I think that's part of the question, right? I mean you -- this was probably the best content quarter you've had. And looking at sort of flattish subs versus previous Q4s, obviously, a great number, but it's kind of in line with what you've done the last few Q4s. What do you read from that? Is the customers sort of hurdle just higher in terms of the amount and quality of content that you need to deliver to get the same number of net adds?\nTed Sarandos : Well, I think what, I guess, Spence was saying, we didn't see it -- we didn't see a hit to our engagement. We didn't see a hit to retention. All those things that would classically lead you to looking at competition.  But it's just do of all those things. Not only are we in a pandemic, we've kind of come in and out of COVID at different levels in 2021 particularly the back half of 2021. So it's created a lot of bumpiness certainly and not steady linear growth, which makes it a little tougher to predict, but all the fundamentals of the business are pretty solid.\nNidhi Gupta : Got it. You announced a U.S. price increase last week. Maybe just help us understand kind of over what time frame you think this will flow through, what kind of churn you might expect?\nGreg Peters : Yeah. I'd say you can anticipate it flowing through over the next quarter, the quarter that we're in right now in Q1. And we largely are seeing in the price changes we've done most recently and for the earliest indications that we have in the U.S., which is still premature because we actually haven't actually rolled it out to any customers yet. What we've seen over the last couple of years, which is that sort of core theory that we have that if we've done a good job investing, the members subscription fees that they paid us into better stories, more great storytelling, bigger movies, more variety.  Then when we come back and ask them occasionally for a little bit more to keep that sort of cycle going, then they're generally willing to do that. And we don't see any significant disruption to the business otherwise in that regard. And I would say generally, when we look at that sort of core theory and we look at also the competitors, if you look at Disney+ as an example, the other streaming services out there as well. And their ability to grow even as we've been growing as well, I think it's really strong endorsement for the core idea that consumers around the world are willing to pay for great entertainment. And it encourages us to continue that investment and to try and deliver more entertainment value and earn more of that share.\nNidhi Gupta : Yeah. It's a good point about your streaming competitors. And when I look at sort of your steady price increases in the U.S., it doesn't seem like you feel too constrained by where those competitors are priced. So is that a true statement? And I guess as long as you're viewing share is sort of multiples of any other streaming service in the U.S. Should we think about your price relative to cable actually as we sort of think about your runway? Not that you'll get there overnight, but as we think about your runway, is that really sort of the comparison we should be thinking about as opposed to other streaming services?\nGreg Peters : We don't have an -- our priority is sort of price target in any given country that we're tracking to. Mostly, we're listening to our members and sort of iteratively doing this walk where the metrics that we see in terms of engagement and churn and acquisition and those kind of things are really our signal that we've done a good job at sort of creating this more value and it's the right time to ask for a little bit more to keep that going. So to the previous comments around competition and things like that. We don't think that it's immediately replaceable or substitutable or good, let's say, right?  And so if we have incredible stories, movies that you can only see on Netflix, great TV shows, unscripted, now games coming, then that really -- the value equation for any given member or member to be in a market is just are they getting good value for what they're paying. And as long as we do a good job there, we feel like we're fulfilling that need.\nNidhi Gupta : Great. You also made a price change in India in the other direction. Maybe just help us understand what you're trying to achieve with that price change?\nGreg Peters : Yeah. I think it follows a whole set of activities that we've been doing in India over the years that we've been operating there and learning more about Indian consumers' tastes, et cetera. And that's broadening the offering in the service across many, many different dimensions. So it's obviously at the core is the content and the programming and seeking to expand that and provide an increased variety and range of programming that appeals and it's attractive to more people in India.  While we're thinking about go-to-market and the partnerships that we have and making sure that we're available with those partners at that place where more people in India will find us. And that gets to payments and many, many, many things. And when we looked at it and we saw sort of the sum total of all those activities. We felt it was the right time to decrease our prices there, to increase accessibility to all of that sort of those incremental value or features that we've been trying to deliver to the market to more Indian consumers.  And we also wanted to do it not just like we did with mobile, which is a good lower entry price point, but do it across the range of plans that we had under the theory that some of those features like the ability to watch on TV with a basic plan really unlocks more value in the service and therefore, would create more retention, more attractiveness to those plan types for those Indian consumers. And again, we're doing this through the lens of what's the long-term sort of revenue maximization, our best guess at that exchange. And so in this case, we're -- basically anticipated that while we decrease ARM, average revenue per member, as a result of the price decreases, we're going to make it up in more subscriber adds. And I would say it's still very early in looking at India. And some of these effects, like retention, it takes a couple of months to get a very clean read on it. But the early data that we are seeing very much supports a positive read on that lens of revenue maximization through these changes.\nReed Hastings : And Nidhi, as you well know, that not all viewers might -- what's unique about India is cable. It is about $3 per month per household. So radically different pricing than the rest of the world, which does impact consumer expectations.\nNidhi Gupta : Right, right. If this approach doesn't give you the desired result, and it sounds like it is so far. But if fast forward 6 months or 12 months from now, it isn't giving you the desired result, would you consider sort of rightsizing your content spend in India? Or maybe consider an ad-supported model? I guess, in other words, how hard do you want to push for India? And are there examples of success you see either in the media industry or outside of it that give you the confidence that you can make money in this market long term?\nReed Hastings : I think it would be a long time before we adjust it materially because in our experience in Brazil, it was brutal for the first couple of years. We thought we'd never break even. I know we've got this great business.  And then, Greg, why don't you talk about the experience in Japan?\nGreg Peters : Yeah. I would use the word brutal in my -- back to that. And obviously, it's a different country, different characteristics in terms of affluence and things like that. But it took us quite a while to unlock all of these components, product market fit, get the right content, all these different pieces. But then once you get that sort of flywheel spinning, it's an incredible market for us and a source of tremendous growth in membership and revenue in the region. So I think we're quite bullish that India isn't fundamentally different in some way that we can't figure out how to tailor our service offering to be attractive to Indian consumers who love entertainment. We know that for sure. And so that, I think gives us a lot of optimism just to continue to work away at it.\nTed Sarandos : I would just add -- sorry, go ahead, Reed.\nReed Hastings : The great news is in every single other major market, we've got the flywheel spinning. The thing that frustrates us is why haven't we been as successful in India, but we're definitely leaning in there.\nTed Sarandos : And there wasn't an easy one in the bunch.\nSpencer Neumann : Well, that's kind of what I was going to say, like what Ted touched on, like for as much as we have what we believe is a terrific business and a terrific business model that scales so well with content that can be created anywhere and travel everywhere. And you see that with our more than 222 basic million paying members around the world, it's also super hard. It's hard in every country.  And every country is on different adoption curve. And we talk about product market fit, but it's -- even though everyone loves film and TV and even games, it is very specific. Entertainment is still fundamentally pretty local around the world. So it's global and local, and we need to figure that out.  So that is actually a good thing about our business is that it scales well, but it's also super difficult. Otherwise, it'd be really easy for everybody to replicate it.\nTed Sarandos : It's -- the team going into producing original content in India being pretty almost impossible when we first started looking at it. And then this quarter alone, we've got original content coming out from Turkey, we have production in Russia, from Argentina, from Mexico, from Sweden, from Denmark. So we've got original content from all corners of the world with 20 originals coming out of Korea this year.  So the idea that they invested in this early and are built up on it. And that it really is going to be something that is going to start to -- we think it will start flowering in India for all the same reasons, a good product market fit, content people love, value that fits through their life and product they can't live without.\nGreg Peters : And I'll triple down on that point as well, Ted. Because -- I mean, we're still learning even now as we have these incredible stories from all these places around the world, how to bring them to that global audience in increasingly effective ways. And it's simple things, obviously, like subtitling and dubbing, and we've subtitled 7 million run time minutes in '21 and dubbed 5 million run time minutes. But at that scale, we're learning actually how to do that better and how to make that localization more compelling to our members, but it also gets to even like things that you wouldn't even anticipate like just how you present these titles in an emotionally evocative way.  And we describe a story maybe as nostalgic or eerie and that means something to us. But you can't just literally translate that. You have to find out in every culture and language around the world, what is that similarly emotionally evocative descriptor that is going to communicate really easily and quickly what a story means. There's just -- there's so much work and incredibly fascinating things that we're learning about how to do that every day.\nTed Sarandos : And in many of those places where we built that out, there was zero infrastructure for subtitling and dubbing.\nNidhi Gupta : Well, speaking of content that travels well. South Korea, as you mentioned, Ted, has been a really bright spot for you. And as you said, you're launching over 20 new shows there this year. What are sort of the unique factors that drove your success in South Korea? And more importantly, what do you think the adoption curve can look like here relative to maybe what you've seen in other markets?\nTed Sarandos : I'd say, first and foremost, we've developed, over the years, an incredible team in Korea and South Korea that has worked with the talent community that recognized the storytelling that really works in Korea, that didn't try to make it different over travel but really try to find all the things about Korean cinema and Korean drama and build them up in a way that people could see kind of new levels of production value.  But it's not like we had to go in and teach anyone in South Korea how to make great content. It's an incredible market for that. And there's always been curiosity around the world. The K drama market has always had little pockets of success all over the place. But I think the ease of delivery that we've offered has kind of pushed that into the mainstream. Yes, there was kind of a turning point with Parasite and Bong Joon-ho's Oscar last year to kind of open up people's minds to it. But we saw that even way before that, with Okja, working with Director Bong, that there was this incredible storytelling culture that we could tap into. And that people would love K dramas and watch them all over the world, it just wasn't that easy to find them. And in Netflix, we've been able to kind of put together the great storytelling and great delivery and a great value proposition that has grown, the watching of Korean content in the U.S., the numbers I would have never believed 3 years ago. So 100% growth in 2021 over 2020.\nNidhi Gupta : Will we get a second season of Squid Game?\nTed Sarandos : Absolutely. The Squid Game universe has just begun.\nNidhi Gupta : Great. Looking forward to that. Shifting gears to Latin America. This region feels like it's maturing at a lower level of penetration than you've seen in the U.S. Is that due to competition? Affordability? Account sharing? Or something else? Or maybe you disagree with the statement that it's actually maturing. But help us understand if there's anything you can do differently to sort of drive penetration levels there higher?\nSpencer Neumann : Well, first, I just wouldn't necessarily read through that it's maturing faster, Nidhi. I mean, again, I just don't want to understate the impact of what we've been going through for the last 2 years. And in Latin America, in particular, has been more strained. It has less kind of government funding and subsidization relative to many parts of the world to kind of fuel their economy.  On top of that, we also continue to increase prices in that market last year across some big countries for us, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina. So between macroeconomic factors and general strain, business is still growing there. We grew by about 2.5 million members last year. So under the kind of pre-COVID growth rates, but still growing. And it is a market where pay TV is healthy. Folks love film and TV.  And so I think there's a long runway of growth there. It's also been a great market for us for Spanish language content that we're creating for the rest of the world. So we don't see -- and the others can chime in, need to change strategy. We continue, like we talked about with India, we're getting better everywhere, every year. We're getting better with our local content in Brazil and Mexico and so forth. So there's a lot more to come, but it's not a fundamental change in strategy.\nNidhi Gupta : Great. That makes sense. Maybe just stepping back, you've talked about 800 million to 900 million homes globally outside of China. That's sort of your TAM, your -- call it 25% penetrated into that. As you're seeing how various markets are playing out in terms of penetration levels, some higher, some lower, obviously, they're all still growing. Has your thought process changed at all on how many of these 800 million to 900 million homes you can have ultimately or sort of the time frame to get there, whether it's higher than you expected or lower than you expected?  And how might you actually evolve your content strategy or your pricing strategy to get the next 200 million subscribers?\nReed Hastings : Yeah. I'd say, Nidhi, on that PTV comparison we look at it. We're in the U.S., at about two thirds of the pay TV high watermark. And so the back third is definitely going to be harder than the first two thirds in terms of appealing more unscripted, more superhero. And we're working on all of that. Because we don't have sports and news. You might say, well, if we get to 80% or something of pay TV, that's a good accomplishment. But also streaming TV is such a better experience than the old linear TV. In some ways, we think to ourselves, we should be higher than pay TV, a combination of lower pricing and better experience. So definitely frustrating for us the current slower growth. That's why it could well be kind of just COVID effects where it could be as you're pushing on smaller market than we thought. I'm not sure why. So we try to be really rigorous of thinking about the long-term. It's possible that we'll get there, but slower than we thought, smart TV adoption, complexity, those kinds of things. But we're still focused on the original thesis of, if we become incredibly compelling, everyone's going to want to be a Netflix (inaudible).\nTed Sarandos : And I know it feels like we've been saying it for a long time, but it's early days. It really is. And I think about the evolving value proposition and how it's still maturing. The idea that big-ticket movies that people really care about premiering it being part of your Netflix subscription is actually taking the value proposition to a new level than it was just a couple of years ago.  So I do think, like I said, it's dynamic market for sure. It may not be as steady as people can think about it in terms of we're going to add X number every month, every quarter, every week. But it's going to -- but there's no question that that's the direction the business is going in.\nNidhi Gupta : Yeah. And Ted, that's a good segue to where I wanted to go next. You had an incredible lineup of films in Q4 with a lot of viewing. I'm curious, what did having a strong film slate in the quarter do for you relative to periods where you didn't have that? Did you see more aggregate engagement, lower churn, more conversation? Just what is sort of unique about delighting your customers with a film versus a show in terms of kind of the benefits that you see?\nTed Sarandos : Yes, there's a big theory, which is that people differently value movies because they always have to pay for it. You had to buy a movie ticket. You have to buy a pay-per-view transaction or DVD. There's always a kind of a transactional and a pretty big one for some people to see a big movie premier in your home. And so there was this kind of temporary effect that some other folks were doing -- this is our -- it's in our permanent model to premier our big movies on the service. And I think people look -- even if you really watch mostly television, you have a movie night, and we can service you on movie night. I think that's a very big important value proposition that we have that's different from everybody else. And these are the movies that people really love and care about. And you start seeing them at the scale of Don't Look Up and Red Notice in Q4, and it gets you to super excited as to be what could be next when -- what's coming next. And for that, we have things like The Adam Project coming up with Ryan Reynolds and John Lee directed coming up in Q1. It's a phenomenal movie for the whole family. With a big action movie from the Russo Brothers like Gray Man with Ryan Gosling, Knives Out 2, Enola Holmes 2.  So with this movie lineup that would be -- that any one studio would go for any one season, we've got new movies every week on Netflix. And they're big movies that people care about. And we think what's the expectation is set and we keep delivering on it, people will react to that, too.\nSpencer Neumann : And Nidhi, I'd just add that at the core, what our members love and what they tell us they love is a great variety of high-quality content. And that means across TV film and hopefully, games over time in a much broader way. So film having a great film offering is, for us, a key part of that equation.  And so I think we're just starting to fulfill more and more of that our member kind of needs and wants and satisfaction. That's what we're seeing. But it's not like it's just so differential than something else as part of that overall quality and variety of entertainment offering.\nTed Sarandos : I also think it differentially serves people watching together. It's much easier to watch a movie together than to make sure you're all tracking on the same episode every week all over the -- if you travel or whatever you do. So that kind of together experience, we can deliver on every weekend on Netflix is pretty great. And I think about even just in the upcoming quarter alone, Spence talked about variety, everyone has a very different tastes. So any one movie is only going to serve a segment of the audience. Now you get big exciting thing like Don't Look Up and Red Notice, you can get to a big chunk of the base, but you're still only getting about 60%.  So to do that, to serve everyone, you have to have a big variety of output. So it does seem like a lot of volume, but it's not all for you. So in Q1 alone we have The Adam Project, I mentioned. We have Munich from Germany, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is kind of a reinvention of that franchise. Tall Girl 2, which is a sequel to one of our big YA romcoms. Home Team with Kevin James, Judd Apatow has got the movie The Bubble, that's all in Q1. And plus original local language films from all over the world as well.  So to meet the kind of a variety of taste we're able to really step up and deliver no matter what that taste is.\nNidhi Gupta : Yeah, that makes sense. Reed you talked on the Q3 call about sort of, over time, building out the whole experience of games, consumer products, live events, et cetera, around some of your IP. And it obviously starts with great IP and great storytelling. But what else do you have to get right operationally and strategically to really build a franchise? And do you feel like you have the pieces in place now?\nReed Hastings : We're building those muscles steadily with our consumer products, both like the Squid Game tracksuits. And then we're making a big push on experiences that are mobile and portable and people, if we can set them up quickly and developing that muscle. Obviously, the gaming muscle were very young on and building. So if you think of a world in a few years where those are strong muscles and then you think of the next Bridgerton or Squid Game coming through, that's what we hope to be able to really pull those pieces together. And then people talk about franchise like it's zero or one. But of course, there's a complete continuum that will add value in the short term to our various titles. And we're doing that already through the consumer products world and having people feel a bigger connection to those big franchises.  So it's already working, but it's probably, I don't know, 20% of what it will be in a couple of years in terms of the auxiliary boost beyond just the title.\nTed Sarandos : And I'd say on that continuum, Reed, you've got Stranger Things, which I'd say is this valuable franchise as exists today in entertainment around the world. We certainly have things that are in their early stages of becoming a franchise like Bridgerton, which we launched our second season of this, our second most popular show ever in Q1.  And also, this year, you'll see an origin story on Queen Charlotte. And this incredible Bridgerton live experiences around the country and around the world that fans will flock to and flood their social media feeds with and there's consumer products that go along with that as well. So it's all those kind of makings of a franchise instead of trying to tapping into one that's been building for 50 years. Can you build it from whole cloud? And I think Stranger Things is a proof point that you can.\nNidhi Gupta : We touched on gaming a little bit. It's very exciting to see some worldwide launches during the quarter. Greg, I know it's early days, but what has sort of the reception and engagement been from the subscriber base? And what have your learnings been as well?\nGreg Peters : Yeah. As you say, it's tremendously exciting to get to this point because we basically have been building the plumbing and all the technical infrastructure just to get to the point where we can do this which is consistently launch games globally to all of our members. And it's great to do that. And now as you point out, we're now really getting to learn from all those games what are the discovery patterns, what are the engagement patterns? How are they performing? What do our members want from games on the service?  And it's still very early days. But generally, what we're seeing is not surprisingly, we have a growing number of monthly active users, daily active users on these games. And so we're generally seeing good growth in that regard. But really, as we're doing this, we've been building in parallel what I'm super excited about it which is the sort of internal development capacity, our own game studio. We've been hiring some incredible talent that brings a set of experience to this process. We've done an acquisition in this space.  And that now allows us to incrementally gradually over a period of time get to that sort of the value that you and Reed were talking about where we get to deliver now interactive experiences that are tied to the IP that we're excited about, that are timed with that. And that I think is really when you're going to see a next level of unlock around the value we can deliver to members.\nNidhi Gupta : Given that gamers tend to sort of consolidate their time around a smaller number of titles compared to video where we tend to consume a wider variety of content. Would it be more efficient to sort of buy your way into some well-known titles to sort of anchor the product? Just the last couple of weeks, we've obviously seen a couple of major companies make big acquisitions or at least announce big acquisitions because this is obviously something that's difficult to build organically. I'm just curious what your reaction to that is and why isn't Netflix participating in big acquisitions given your aspirations in gaming?\nGreg Peters : Well, I mean it was exciting to see the activity in the space. And I think to some degree, it's an endorsement of the core thesis that we have around subscription being a great model to connect consumers around the world with games and game experiences.  And we’re open to licensing, accessing large game IP that people will recognize. And I think you'll see some of that happen over the year to come. But we also see back to test like building out a whole cloth and the ability to take the franchises or the big titles, let's call it, that we are excited about and actually develop interactive experiences that are connected to those. We see a huge long-term multiyear opportunity in that, too.  So we're very open. We're going to be experimental and try a bunch of things. But I would say the eyes that we have on the long-term prize really center more around our ability to create properties that are connected to the universes, the characters, the stories that we're building in other places and sort of magnify that value for the fans of those stories.\nSpencer Neumann : Nidhi, we have time for two more questions.\nNidhi Gupta : Okay. Maybe Reed, just a bigger picture question for you, and Spencer, I might have more than a couple of questions. But you have this global subscription product that's inside sort of hundreds of millions of households around the world. And you really nailed 2D lean back content, but there is this whole world of interactive or semi interactive content, whether it's gaming or fitness or education, and at the more extreme end, there's VR content, and now everyone is talking about the metaverse.  You've obviously already gotten going on gaming. But as you look at sort of this broad spectrum of content, how much of it do you want to sort of wrap your subscription around thinking about the long-term?\nReed Hastings : When you say how much do you want to, that would be a high number. But we have to be differentially great at it. We there's no point of just being in it. That's very dilutive of the whole proposition. And so it took us several years to get great at English original series. And you saw in the letter on the Google Search trends how well we did there. We built with a lot of effort, a really strong film franchise, and that's -- Ted calls it just the third inning. It's like we're really just getting going to what we think we're going to be able to do there.  Of course, we've got all the international content. We've got unscripted, documentaries. And then gaming, which initially were focused on the mobile gaming is a big one. So I would say when mobile gaming is world-leading and we're some of the best producers and like where we are at film today, 2 of the top 10 for our gaming, then you should ask, okay, what's next? Because we're definitely crawl, walk, run and like let's nail the thing and not just be in it for the sake of being in it or for a press release, but we got to please our members by having the absolute best in the category.  And Ted and Greg have been doing a terrific job on that. And we'll just continue to work on that. So queue it up for that. When we're winning in games. Then we'll take the question.\nNidhi Gupta : Great. Spence, just turning over to you on margins. Does the guidance for a lower level of margin -- and you gave a lot of explanation around that in the letter -- but outside of sort of the FX impact, does it have more to do with some of these incremental investments we're talking about, like games and perhaps consumer products? Or does it have more to do with sort of the lower level of revenue growth that you're expecting?\nSpencer Neumann : No, it's really just FX, Nidhi. So as we said in the letter, we lost about $1 billion of expected revenue in '22 through FX. That's about 2 points of margin. So if you just kind of look at our guide and add that back on, we're right on our pace of adding about 3 points of margin per year. And I can't forget we were over delivering on margin in the last couple of years. So that's really all that's happening here. And the FX move happened in really the last 6 months of last year. So what we've always said is we don't want to swing the business unnecessarily fast. We want to be able to invest in a healthy way into our growth opportunities. And over time, we will then rightsize our -- appropriately our investment levels, our cost structure, our pricing in order to rightsize for where the currencies are coming in. And so this gives us some time to do it. So it gives us a little time, but we will catch back up. We're still committed to roughly 3 -- 3, average of 3 points of margin increase over any two year period. But there's no change there. We've been factoring in our content investment, our game investment all along. And I just want to say in our growth, too. We talk a lot about this deceleration. Obviously, we'd like to grow faster, but there's still very healthy growth in this business. What you're seeing in -- we ended the year last year with 19% growth year-over-year. What you've seen the guide is 10% revenue growth for Q1, but that's a bit misleading again because of FX. There's about 4 points of drag in our revenue in Q1.  So the under -- what I would argue, FX adjusted constant currency for Q1 year-over-year is about 14% growth. It's also a tough comp year-over-year in Q1 because you may remember, we increased prices in the U.S. and Q4 of '20, which flowed through to Q1 of '21 is when it was really materialized. So the year-over-year comp is tough. So the underlying organic revenue growth in the business is, right now, at least in Q1, more like 15%, plus 15%, 16%, 17%. So that's -- that's at least just in the quarter. And that's still very healthy underlying growth in the business. I don't want to dismiss that. We'd love to be growing faster. We'd love to not have the negative FX swings, but still very healthy growth in the business.\nReed Hastings: Nidhi, since it's your last earnings interview, I will grant you one extra question.\nNidhi Gupta : I have one last question, this will be the last one, but it's also for Spence. It's very exciting that you'll become sustainably free cash flow positive this year. Congratulations on reaching this milestone. I feel like I've been waiting 10 years to ask this question, but how will you balance M\u0026A and buybacks with your free cash flow?  And maybe sort of related to that, have we peaked in terms of that ratio of cash content spend to amortization? And how long will it take for earnings and free cash flow to kind of converge?\nSpencer Neumann : I can't believe you wanted to end with me, Nidhi. There's so many more exciting people to speak with on the call. So we appreciate what you said there. It is a big milestone for us to be cash flow positive going forward. We're excited for that. The business model has been proving out. So that's great in terms of our increasing profits, profit margins over time as well as cash. In terms of use of cash, and Spencer, you can chime in, too, but as we've talked about in prior calls, our top priority is to be responsible stewards of the business and our cash but to invest in the healthy growth of our business and strategically invest in the business, first, organically, if there's been opportunistically that M\u0026A is not the strategy for us per se. M\u0026A is a tactic to accelerate our strategy, whether it's to accelerate our content capabilities and capacity or just acquisition of IP, like all across film, TV and games as you've seen.  And what's left over after that, we're not going to sit on excess cash as we've said. Our capital allocation plan is as it's been, which is to have roughly 2 months of revenue in the form of cash on our balance sheet, and excess beyond that, we'll return to shareholders opportunistically as we have done. We did that through the tune of about $600 million last year in share repurchase. And we're authorized up to $5 billion share repurchase. So that's still our plan. In terms of when the -- those ratios converge and earnings and cash flow look the same, I don't want to put a prediction out there. We're still in a very much in growth mode as a business. So it will continue to converge over time, but I don't want to declare a specific peak. It's been going in the right direction over a multiyear period. And it will continue to do so.\nSpencer Wang : The only thing I would add to that, Nidhi, is just on the capital allocation part. Just to remind you, our balance sheet target is for gross debt of about $10 billion to $15 billion. We ended the quarter slightly above the $15 billion mark. So as we said in the letter, we will be paying down about $700 million in Q1.  But obviously delevering a bit is something you should anticipate in terms of use of cash. And then just lastly, on the EPS free cash flow question. So I just want to remind you, there are some below-the-line items like the non-cash remeasurement of our euro bonds that can skew EPS in any sort of given quarter, so just a call out there. But thank you for your questions. I'm going to turn it over to Ted now to -- for his closing remarks and to take us home.\nTed Sarandos : Nidhi, thank you so much for these and thanks for today. The love of film and TV and games has built big businesses for people who can figure out what people love, build a creative environment that creators know how to feed it and then deliver it to fans with a value proposition that they appreciate.  I think those fans are positively moving from old linear models and transactional models to more fan-friendly subscription services that are with high-quality programming, delivered well with great value. That's absolutely happening, and it's happening all over the world. The pace of the migration may be a little hard to call from time to time when there are kind of very global events or even local conditions, but it's absolutely happening. There's no question of that. Films that you love and series that you define yourself by and games that thrill you, that's a pretty great business. We're thrilled to be in it. We're also planning to continue to improve what we're doing and to grow this by growing revenue, by growing profits and by growing audience affinity around the world. So once again, Nidhi, if I can see you in person, I'd give you this. I've got 2 of them. Where is the other one?\nGreg Peters : Ted, I found one for you.\nSpencer Neumann : Thank you, Nidhi.
